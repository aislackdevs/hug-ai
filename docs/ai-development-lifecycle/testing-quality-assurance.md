# Testing & Quality Assurance

> Ensuring software reliability, security, and fairness through comprehensive AI-generated and human-validated testing practices.

## Objectives & Scope
- Automatically generate and maintain unit, integration, performance, and bias tests.
- Validate functional correctness, security compliance, and ethical fairness across codebase.
- Prevent test brittleness by updating tests alongside code changes.

## AI Agent Roles & Human Participants
- **Test Agent**: Generates test cases, predicts defect hotspots, and maintains test suites.
- **Internal Reviewer Agent**: Reviews test coverage, verifies edge-case handling, and flags anomalies.
- **Prompt Refiner Agent**: Refines prompts for scenario-based and bias test generation.
- **Human Participants**:
  - QA Engineers: Validate and approve AI-generated test suites.
  - Security Engineers: Review security and vulnerability tests.
  - Data Scientists: Assess bias and fairness test results.
  - Developers: Integrate tests and fix defects.

## Key Artifacts & Deliverables
- Automated test suites (unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, bias).
- Test data sets and mock environments for reproducibility.
- Defect hotspot and bias analysis reports.
- Test coverage and quality dashboards.
- Test maintenance logs detailing updates and deprecations.

## Governance Checkpoints
- **Test Suite Approval**: QA sign-off on generated tests before merging.
- **Security Gate**: Mandatory pass on security and vulnerability scans.
- **Bias Assessment**: Human review of fairness metrics and flagged items.
- **Performance Gate**: Validate performance tests against SLA thresholds.

## Metrics & Quality Gates
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by automated tests.
- **Defect Escape Rate**: Defects found in production vs. pre-release.
- **Test Flakiness**: Rate of intermittent test failures.
- **Bias Violation Count**: Number of fairness criteria breaches.
- **Test Maintenance Rate**: Frequency of test updates per code change.

## Tools & Integrations
- **Frameworks**: PyTest, JUnit, Jest, Selenium, Cypress for test execution.
- **Performance Testing**: JMeter, Locust, Gatling for load and stress tests.
- **Security Scanning**: OWASP ZAP, Snyk, Veracode for automated vulnerability detection.
- **Bias & Fairness**: IBM AI Fairness 360, Fairlearn for bias detection.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI for test automation pipelines.
- **Mocking & Data**: Faker, Mock Server, Testcontainers for isolated environments.
- **Coverage Tools**: coverage.py, Istanbul/NYC for coverage measurement.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
=== "Best Practices"
    - Integrate AI-generated tests early in development to catch issues sooner.
    - Review and prune flaky tests regularly to maintain reliability.
    - Combine AI-generated scenarios with manual exploratory testing.
    - Automate test data management and environment setup for consistency.
    - Track test metrics in dashboards to identify coverage gaps.

=== "Pitfalls to Avoid"
    - Blindly trusting generated tests without human review.
    - Allowing stale tests to accumulate, leading to brittle suites.
    - Focusing solely on functional tests and ignoring non-functional aspects.
    - Neglecting bias and security tests for faster release cycles.
    - Overloading CI pipelines with redundant or overly slow tests.
