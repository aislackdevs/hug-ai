# Maintenance

> Proactive monitoring, technical debt management, and continuous improvement enabled by AI insights and human control.

## Objectives & Scope
- Continuously monitor system health, performance, and code quality.
- Detect anomalies, predict failures, and manage technical debt.
- Perform dependency updates, security patches, and refactorings.
- Validate and retrain AI models to prevent model drift.
- Keep documentation and runbooks up to date with system changes.

## AI Agent Roles & Human Participants
- **Maintenance Agent**: Scans code for technical debt, outdated dependencies, and optimization opportunities.
- **Performance Agent**: Monitors metrics, identifies performance bottlenecks, and suggests improvements.
- **Security Agent**: Automates vulnerability scanning and patch recommendations.
- **Prompt Refiner Agent**: Refines maintenance task prompts and clarifies remediation steps.
- **Human Participants**:
  - DevOps/SRE Engineers: Approve and execute maintenance tasks.
  - Security Engineers: Validate and implement security patches.
  - Developers: Review and integrate refactorings.
  - Technical Writers: Update documentation and runbooks.

## Key Artifacts & Deliverables
- Technical debt and code health assessment reports.
- Model drift and performance analytics dashboards.
- Scheduled maintenance plans and playbooks.
- Updated infrastructure and dependency change logs.
- Revised documentation, runbooks, and release notes.

## Governance Checkpoints
- **Maintenance Planning Review**: Approve maintenance schedule and scope.
- **Security Patch Gate**: Validate critical vulnerabilities and patch strategies.
- **Model Drift Checkpoint**: Human review of significant model performance changes.
- **Documentation Approval**: Ensure all changes are reflected in system documentation.

## Metrics & Quality Gates
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: Percentage of code requiring refactoring.
- **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)**: Speed of identifying issues post-deployment.
- **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)**: Time to resolve detected incidents.
- **Model Drift Frequency**: Rate of model accuracy degradation over time.
- **Dependency Vulnerability Backlog**: Number of unpatched security issues.

## Tools & Integrations
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube, ESLint, static analyzers for ongoing code health.
- **Monitoring & APM**: Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic for real-time observability.
- **Model Monitoring**: Evidently.ai, Seldon Core for drift detection.
- **Dependency Management**: Dependabot, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check.
- **Document Management**: MkDocs, Confluence for runbooks and knowledge base.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated maintenance jobs in GitHub Actions, Jenkins.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
=== "Best Practices"
    - Schedule regular maintenance windows and communicate to stakeholders.
    - Automate dependency updates and review with human oversight.
    - Prioritize technical debt tasks in the backlog.
    - Use canary releases for infrastructure and code patches.
    - Keep runbooks and documentation in sync with system changes.

=== "Pitfalls to Avoid"
    - Accumulating small issues until they become major outages.
    - Running maintenance tasks without stakeholder sign-off.
    - Ignoring model drift until performance degrades significantly.
    - Neglecting to update documentation after changes.
    - Over-relying on AI recommendations without human validation.
