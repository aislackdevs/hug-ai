# Planning & Requirements

> Establishing a solid foundation by capturing, refining, and validating requirements through AI-driven analysis and human governance.

## Objectives & Scope
- Accurately elicit stakeholder needs and translate them into actionable user stories and tasks.
- Decompose high-level features into granular work items with clear acceptance criteria.
- Provide data-driven effort estimates and define project scope boundaries.
- Identify compliance, security, and ethical constraints early in the process.

## AI Agent Roles & Human Participants
- **Requirements Analyzer Agent**: Reviews documentation and extracts user stories, acceptance criteria, and edge cases.
- **Prompt Refiner Agent**: Refines stakeholder inputs into clear, unambiguous prompts for AI processing.
- **Router Agent**: Orchestrates tasks, routes requirements artifacts to appropriate agents or human reviewers.
- **Human Participants**:
  - Product Owner / Business Analyst: Validates and prioritizes requirements.
  - Stakeholders: Provide domain context and approve deliverables.
  - Compliance Officer: Reviews regulatory implications.

## Key Artifacts & Deliverables
- Validated user story backlog with detailed acceptance criteria.
- Work breakdown structure and task decomposition.
- Effort estimation report with confidence intervals.
- Initial risk and compliance assessment matrix.
- Audit log of AI suggestions and human decisions.

## Governance Checkpoints
- **Kickoff Review**: Human stakeholders review and approve AI-generated user stories and estimates.
- **Scope Baseline Sign-off**: Formal approval of project scope, priorities, and constraints.
- **Compliance Gate**: Verification of regulatory and security requirements before moving to design.

## Metrics & Quality Gates
- **Story Accuracy Rate**: Percentage of AI-generated stories accepted without modification.
- **Estimation Variance**: Difference between estimated and actual effort.
- **Requirement Completeness**: Ratio of identified requirements to total scoped features.
- **Change Request Frequency**: Number of requirement revisions after sign-off.
- **Governance Compliance Rate**: Percentage of mandatory checkpoints passed on time.

## Tools & Integrations
- **Requirements Management**: Integration with Jira, Azure DevOps, or similar tools for backlog tracking.
- **RAG & Code Search**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for sourcing domain knowledge from code and docs.
- **Audit Logging**: Centralized logging via ELK, Splunk, or similar platforms.
- **Collaboration Platforms**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Confluence for stakeholder communication.
- **AI Model Registry**: Version-controlled models and prompt templates stored in dedicated registry.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
=== "Best Practices"
    - Involve human domain experts early and iteratively to validate AI outputs.
    - Use standardized prompt templates to ensure consistency across analyses.
    - Keep user stories small, atomic, and testable.
    - Document acceptance criteria clearly and link to compliance requirements.
    - Maintain an immutable audit trail of prompts, responses, and approvals.

=== "Pitfalls to Avoid"
    - Overloading AI with ambiguous or contradictory prompts.
    - Skipping human validation of critical requirements.
    - Underestimating non-functional and compliance requirements.
    - Allowing scope creep by not enforcing approval gates.
    - Neglecting to version-control prompt templates and AI configurations.
