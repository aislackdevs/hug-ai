# Deep Dive: AI Development Lifecycle

> This section provides an in-depth exploration of HUG AIâ€™s adapted Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), outlining objectives, roles, deliverables, governance steps, metrics, and best practices for each phase.

## Dedicated Phase Guides

Each phase will have a dedicated deep-dive page covering:

- Objectives & Scope
- AI Agent Roles & Human Participants
- Key Artifacts & Deliverables
- Governance Checkpoints
- Metrics & Quality Gates
- Tools & Integrations
- Best Practices & Pitfalls

## Phases Overview

The following links will lead to the phase-specific pages:

- [1. Planning & Requirements](planning-requirements.md)
- [2. Design & Architecture](design-architecture.md)
- [3. Implementation](implementation.md)
- [4. Testing & Quality Assurance](testing-quality-assurance.md)
- [5. Deployment](deployment.md)
- [6. Maintenance](maintenance.md)
- [Cross-Phase Governance & Monitoring](governance-monitoring.md)
