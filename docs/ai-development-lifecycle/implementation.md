# Implementation

> Accelerating code delivery with AI-generated scaffolding, real-time suggestions, and automated documentation while ensuring quality and governance.

## Objectives & Scope
- Generate code scaffolding and refactor legacy code based on design artifacts.
- Provide real-time coding suggestions, refactoring hints, and code completion.
- Automate inline and external documentation updates for code modules.
- Enforce coding standards, security guidelines, and best practices.
- Integrate generated code into existing codebases with minimal disruption.

## AI Agent Roles & Human Participants
- **Implementation Agent**: Generates code modules, scaffolds frameworks, and applies refactoring.
- **Documentation Writer Agent**: Creates and updates code comments, README files, and API docs.
- **Prompt Refiner Agent**: Clarifies and refines prompts for accurate code generation.
- **Human Participants**:
  - Software Developers: Review, adjust, and integrate AI-generated code.
  - Code Reviewer / Architect: Validate adherence to architecture and standards.
  - Security Engineer: Ensure generated code meets security policies.

## Key Artifacts & Deliverables
- Generated code modules, classes, and functions organized by feature.
- Updated inline code comments and external documentation artifacts.
- Pull request branches containing AI-generated changes.
- Linting and static analysis reports highlighting style and potential issues.
- Refactoring logs detailing automated changes.

## Governance Checkpoints
- **Pre-Merge Review**: Human approval of AI-generated pull requests.
- **Style Gate**: Automated linting and formatting checks must pass.
- **Security Gate**: Static code analysis and vulnerability scans with zero critical findings.
- **Documentation Gate**: All new components must have associated documentation before merge.

## Metrics & Quality Gates
- **Code Acceptance Rate**: Percentage of AI-generated code accepted without modification.
- **Lint Compliance**: Rate of passing automated style and lint checks.
- **Test Coverage Impact**: Change in code coverage after merging generated code.
- **Refactoring Success Rate**: Percentage of automated refactorings that reduce technical debt.
- **Review Turnaround Time**: Average time to review AI-generated pull requests.

## Tools & Integrations
- **Code Editors**: VSCode, IntelliJ with AI extensions for local suggestions.
- **Linting & Formatting**: ESLint, Prettier, Pylint, Black to enforce style.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI for automated checks.
- **Static Analysis**: SonarQube, CodeQL for security and quality scans.
- **Code Search & RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for pattern reuse.
- **Documentation Tools**: Sphinx, MkDocs, or Javadoc for API docs.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
=== "Best Practices"
    - Review and test AI-generated code incrementally rather than in bulk.
    - Keep generated code modular and decoupled to simplify testing and maintenance.
    - Pair AI suggestions with developer expertise to fine-tune implementations.
    - Maintain a library of prompt templates for consistent code generation.
    - Use feature flags to safely roll out AI-generated features in production.

=== "Pitfalls to Avoid"
    - Blindly merging large AI-generated diffs without human inspection.
    - Over-customizing generated code, which can reduce maintainability.
    - Ignoring context-specific business logic when refactoring automatically.
    - Letting AI bypass existing code review or security processes.
    - Failing to update documentation or tests alongside code changes.
