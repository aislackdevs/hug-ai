# Governance & Monitoring

> Embedding robust oversight, auditability, and feedback loops across all phases to ensure compliance, quality, and continuous improvement.

## Objectives & Scope
- Provide end-to-end audit trails of AI prompts, outputs, and human decisions.
- Automate compliance checks and risk assessments throughout the lifecycle.
- Establish recurring feedback loops to refine AI models and processes.
- Maintain visibility into project health via dashboards and alerts.

## AI Agent Roles & Human Participants
- **Monitoring Agent**: Continuously collects metrics, logs, and audit data across phases.
- **Compliance Agent**: Automates regulatory checks, policy enforcement, and generates compliance reports.
- **Router Agent**: Ensures tasks enter appropriate governance checkpoints.
- **Human Participants**:
  - Compliance Officer: Reviews audit trails and approves policy exceptions.
  - Stakeholders: Validate that governance outputs meet business requirements.
  - Project Manager: Oversees governance schedule and risk mitigation.
  - QA Lead: Ensures monitoring covers quality gates.

## Key Artifacts & Deliverables
- Immutable audit logs capturing AI interactions and human approvals.
- Compliance and risk assessment reports for each phase.
- Governance dashboards (KPIs: quality, risk, compliance, velocity).
- Feedback reports summarizing model performance and process improvements.
- Task status and exception logs for review.

## Governance Checkpoints
- **AI Suggestion Approval**: Human sign-off before critical AI outputs are applied.
- **Risk Assessment Gate**: Automated and manual review of identified risks.
- **Compliance Verification**: Ensure regulatory checks pass before releases.
- **Model Retraining Decision**: Triggered by drift detection or performance degradation.

## Metrics & Quality Gates
- **Audit Coverage Rate**: Percentage of actions logged and traceable.
- **Compliance Pass Rate**: Ratio of successful automated compliance checks.
- **Risk Incident Count**: Number of governance breaches or exceptions.
- **Feedback Loop Frequency**: Rate of data-driven process refinements.
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Survey-based governance effectiveness score.

## Tools & Integrations
- **Logging & Audit**: ELK Stack, Splunk, or CloudWatch Logs for immutable logs.
- **Compliance Automation**: OpenPolicyAgent, Chef InSpec for policy as code.
- **Monitoring & Metrics**: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog for dashboards.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Airflow, Argo Workflows for governance pipelines.
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty, Opsgenie for governance exceptions.
- **Analytics & ML Ops**: Kubeflow, MLflow for feedback integration.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
=== "Best Practices"
    - Define clear governance policies and embed them into pipelines.
    - Keep audit logs immutable and easily queryable.
    - Automate as much of the compliance process as possible.
    - Use dashboards to surface governance metrics to stakeholders.
    - Schedule regular governance reviews and retrospectives.

=== "Pitfalls to Avoid"
    - Collecting data without actionable dashboards or alerts.
    - Overlooking human sign-offs on critical AI decisions.
    - Allowing governance processes to become bottlenecks.
    - Ignoring governance metric trends until issues arise.
    - Failing to update policies as regulations evolve.
