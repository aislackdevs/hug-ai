# Deployment

> Automating the release process, ensuring reliable rollouts, and maintaining system stability through AI-assisted pipelines and human oversight.

## Objectives & Scope
- Automate infrastructure provisioning and environment configuration.
- Define and implement deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling updates).
- Ensure zero-downtime releases and reliable rollback mechanisms.
- Validate configuration consistency and dependency management across environments.

## AI Agent Roles & Human Participants
- **Deployment Agent**: Generates infrastructure-as-code scripts, deployment pipelines, and rollback strategies.
- **DevOps Agent**: Orchestrates CI/CD workflows, monitors deployments, and handles observability integrations.
- **Prompt Refiner Agent**: Clarifies deployment requirements and refines environment-specific prompts.
- **Human Participants**:
  - Operations Engineer: Reviews and authorizes deployment plans.
  - Site Reliability Engineer: Monitors and validates production rollouts.
  - Security Engineer: Ensures deployment adheres to security policies.

## Key Artifacts & Deliverables
- Infrastructure-as-Code templates (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.).
- CI/CD pipeline definitions and scripts.
- Deployment runbooks and health check configurations.
- Automated rollback plans and failure recovery procedures.
- Environment inventory and dependency manifests.

## Governance Checkpoints
- **Pre-Deployment Approval**: Human sign-off on deployment plan and environment readiness.
- **Staging Validation**: Automated smoke tests and manual sanity checks in staging.
- **Production Go/No-Go**: Final review of metrics and risk assessments before production release.
- **Rollback Drill**: Scheduled exercises to verify rollback and recovery procedures.

## Metrics & Quality Gates
- **Deployment Success Rate**: Percentage of successful deployments vs. attempts.
- **Mean Time to Deploy (MTTD)**: Average time to complete a deployment.
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Time to restore service after a failure.
- **Configuration Drift Rate**: Instances of environment drift detected.
- **Change Failure Rate**: Proportion of deployments causing incidents.

## Tools & Integrations
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Pulumi.
- **CI/CD Platforms**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI.
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes, ECS, Nomad for deployment management.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Datadog.
- **Rollback Automation**: Argo Rollouts, Spinnaker for advanced strategies.
- **Artifact Repositories**: Docker Registry, Nexus, Artifactory.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
=== "Best Practices"
    - Use immutable infrastructure patterns to simplify rollbacks.
    - Test deployment scripts in isolated environments before production.
    - Automate canary and blue-green deployments for safe rollouts.
    - Integrate health checks and automated monitoring into pipelines.
    - Maintain clear documentation and runbooks for manual interventions.

=== "Pitfalls to Avoid"
    - Relying solely on manual approvals without automated gates.
    - Neglecting environment parity between staging and production.
    - Overcomplicating pipelines with unnecessary steps.
    - Ignoring deployment logs and metrics until incidents occur.
    - Failing to practice rollback drills regularly.
