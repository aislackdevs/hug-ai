# Design & Architecture

> Crafting scalable, secure, and maintainable system designs with AI-generated patterns and human expertise.

## Objectives & Scope
- Generate architecture proposals and select design patterns aligned with requirements.
- Define system boundaries, interactions, and data flows for modularity and scalability.
- Produce interface contracts (APIs, schemas) and validate against security and compliance standards.

## AI Agent Roles & Human Participants
- **Architecture Agent**: Proposes patterns, creates diagrams, and generates design rationale.
- **Security Agent**: Performs threat modeling, identifies vulnerabilities, and enforces compliance.
- **Prompt Refiner Agent**: Clarifies ambiguous design prompts and refines architecture queries.
- **Human Participants**:
  - Solution Architect: Reviews and approves design artifacts.
  - Security/Compliance Officer: Validates security, privacy, and regulatory requirements.
  - Domain Experts: Provide context on business rules and domain constraints.

## Key Artifacts & Deliverables
- System context and component diagrams (C4, sequence diagrams).
- Design pattern documentation with rationale and trade-offs.
- API contracts (OpenAPI, GraphQL) and data schema definitions.
- Security & ethics review report with risk mitigations.
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capturing key decisions.

## Governance Checkpoints
- **Pre-Design Review**: Validate requirements alignment and scope before detailed design.
- **Architecture Review Board**: Human-led review of AI-generated diagrams and patterns.
- **Security & Compliance Gate**: Sign-off on threat model, encryption, and data handling.

## Metrics & Quality Gates
- **Design Completeness**: Percentage of requirements covered by design artifacts.
- **Security Risk Score**: Aggregated severity of identified threats.
- **Pattern Reuse Index**: Ratio of reused patterns to custom implementations.
- **API Compliance Rate**: Percentage of endpoints conforming to contract specifications.

## Tools & Integrations
- **Diagramming**: Mermaid, diagrams.net, Structurizr for C4 models.
- **API Tooling**: Swagger/OpenAPI, GraphQL Code Generator.
- **Security Scanning**: OWASP ZAP, Snyk, static analysis tools.
- **ADR Management**: Markdown ADR templates or tools like adr-tools.
- **Collaboration Platforms**: Confluence, Miro, Slack for design discussions.
- **AI Assistance**: RAG-enabled code search for pattern libraries and past architecture examples.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
=== "Best Practices"
    - Involve security and domain experts early to validate assumptions.
    - Favor simple, modular designs over complex monoliths.
    - Document all design decisions in ADRs and link to requirements.
    - Use established patterns (e.g., CQRS, event-driven) judiciously based on context.
    - Keep API contracts versioned and backward-compatible.

=== "Pitfalls to Avoid"
    - Over-engineering with unnecessary patterns or microservices.
    - Ignoring non-functional requirements such as performance and scalability.
    - Skipping security validation for early prototypes.
    - Failing to maintain synchronization between diagrams, code, and documentation.
    - Neglecting to record design trade-offs and alternatives.
