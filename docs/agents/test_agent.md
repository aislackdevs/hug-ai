# Test Agent

The **Test Agent** is responsible for generating and validating test cases across the software development lifecycle. It assists in writing unit, integration, and edge tests based on implementation and requirements.

## Role and Purpose

This agent helps:

- Automatically generate unit and integration test cases
- Suggest edge cases and negative scenarios
- Improve test coverage through prompt-driven analysis
- Output tests in the project's language and framework

It supports continuous validation while reducing the burden on developers.

## Input

- Source code modules
- Component specifications
- Functional requirements
- Accepted frameworks and language constraints

## Output

- Structured test files (e.g., `test_auth.py`, `TestUserFlow.java`)
- Coverage analysis reports (optional)
- Suggestions for untested paths or edge scenarios

## Example Output (Pytest)

```python
def test_validate_email_valid():
    assert validate_email("user@example.com")

def test_validate_email_invalid():
    assert not validate_email("invalid-email")
```

## Governance & Validation

- Test files must pass linting and coverage thresholds
- Reviewed manually in early stages, CI-enforced later
- Coverage tools (e.g., Istanbul, pytest-cov) may be invoked

## Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
agent: test_agent
input_sources:
  - source_code/*.py
  - specs/*.yaml
language: python
framework: pytest
output_format: test_files
prompt_type: unit+integration
post_actions:
  - run_linter
  - evaluate_coverage
```

## Integration

This agent is invoked:

- After code is generated by the Implementation Agent
- During pre-commit hooks and CI pipelines
- In regression and refactor validation phases

It feeds into the validation feedback loop and helps prioritize manual QA.
