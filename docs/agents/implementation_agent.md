# Implementation Agent

The **Implementation Agent** is responsible for generating code based on validated requirements and architectural guidelines. It supports developers by automating repetitive tasks, scaffolding modules, and producing clean, testable code.

## Role and Purpose

This agent helps:

- Generate code snippets and full modules from specifications
- Enforce architectural patterns and naming conventions
- Include inline documentation and usage comments
- Integrate unit tests or function-level tests automatically

It complements human development efforts, accelerating productivity while requiring oversight.

## Input

- Component specs from the Architecture Agent
- Requirements definitions
- Coding standards and style guides

## Output

- Source code files (e.g., `.py`, `.ts`, `.go`, etc.)
- Accompanying test files
- Optional `README` or inline documentation
- Git commit-ready artifacts with summaries

## Example Output (Python)

```python
def validate_email(email: str) -> bool:
    """Checks if the given email is valid using regex."""
    pattern = r"^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$"
    return re.match(pattern, email) is not None
```

## Governance & Validation

- All generated code must be reviewed and committed by a developer
- Test coverage reports are validated through CI pipelines
- Prompts and configs are version-controlled per repo or project

## Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
agent: implementation_agent
input_sources:
  - component_specs.yaml
  - coding_standards.md
output_format: code
language: python
prompt_type: functional_module_generation
post_actions:
  - generate_unit_tests
  - insert_inline_docs
```

## Integration

This agent runs throughout the sprint cycle and is triggered as new components are defined. It connects to:

- Test Agent
- Documentation Writer Agent
- Security Agent

It is a key productivity enhancer but requires rigorous human review for production code.
