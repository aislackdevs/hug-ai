# AI Agents Overview

In HUG AI, AI agents are at the core of collaboration — each designed to support a specific phase or task in the software development lifecycle.

These agents **do not act autonomously**. They are orchestrated, auditable, and operate within strict human-defined boundaries and configurations.

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent in HUG AI is a role-defined process that:

- Executes a task via prompts and structured inputs
- Returns outputs in version-controlled formats
- Works under the supervision of a developer or operator
- Is governed by YAML configuration files

Each agent acts like a "specialist assistant" for one part of the lifecycle — similar to how a QA engineer, architect, or DevOps specialist would work on a team.

## Agent Responsibilities

Each agent has a clear scope and operates based on:

- **Role-specific prompts**
- **Controlled context windows**
- **Expected input/output schemas**
- **Chained or nested tasks, where needed**

For example:

| Agent                      | Role                                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `requirements_analyzer`   | Extracts or clarifies product requirements                |
| `architecture_agent`      | Proposes modular architecture based on goals              |
| `implementation_agent`    | Writes code based on specs and previous decisions         |
| `test_agent`              | Generates unit, integration, or edge test cases           |
| `security_agent`          | Flags potential security issues and suggests mitigations  |
| `deployment_agent`        | Prepares deployment scripts, Helm charts, IaC             |
| `maintenance_agent`       | Assists with logs, bug reports, and patch suggestions     |

## Human-Governed by Design

All agents must operate under:

- **Human prompt approval** (either interactive or pre-defined)
- **Code review requirements**
- **Workflow stage constraints** (agents cannot jump stages autonomously)

## YAML-Based Configuration

Agents are configured through modular YAML templates which include:

- Inputs and context structure
- Prompt types and rules
- Expected response schema
- Post-processing logic
- Routing to other agents (if needed)

This makes agent behavior **predictable, repeatable, and traceable**.

## Collaboration Patterns

Agents can work in:

- **Sequential chains** (e.g., requirements → design → code)
- **Parallel workflows** (e.g., doc writer + test generator)
- **Fallback or retry modes** (e.g., router selects a backup agent)

These patterns can be modeled, simulated, and monitored like human team workflows.
