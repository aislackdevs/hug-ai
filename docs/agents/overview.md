# AI Agents Overview

HUG AI employs a **multi-agent system** where specialized AI agents collaborate to deliver complete software development solutions while maintaining human oversight and governance at every critical decision point.

## Agent Architecture

### 🤖 **What is a HUG AI Agent?**

A HUG AI agent is a specialized AI system that:

- **Focuses on specific expertise**: Each agent masters a particular aspect of software development
- **Operates under governance**: All actions require human validation at defined checkpoints
- **Maintains context**: Preserves project knowledge and decision history
- **Ensures traceability**: Every action is logged and auditable
- **Adapts to technology**: Works across any programming language or framework

### 🏗️ **Agent Design Principles**

**Human-Centric Control**
- Agents assist and accelerate human developers, never replace them
- Critical decisions always involve human judgment and approval
- Transparent operation with complete audit trails

**Specialized Expertise**
- Each agent is optimized for specific development tasks
- Deep domain knowledge in their area of specialization
- Consistent application of best practices and standards

**Collaborative Intelligence**
- Agents share context and coordinate activities
- Intelligent handoffs between agents preserve project knowledge
- Parallel execution where appropriate for efficiency

## Human Governance Integration

### 🎯 **Governance Checkpoints**

Agents operate with built-in governance checkpoints:

- **After Requirements Analysis**: Business validation and stakeholder approval
- **After Architecture Design**: Technical review and security assessment
- **After Implementation**: Code quality review and testing validation
- **Before Deployment**: Production readiness and final approval

### 👥 **Approval Workflows**

```yaml
# .hugai/governance.yaml
approval_workflows:
  requirements_changes:
    approvers: ["product-manager", "business-analyst"]
    timeout: "24h"
    
  architecture_changes:
    approvers: ["tech-lead", "principal-architect"]
    timeout: "48h"
    
  security_changes:
    approvers: ["security-lead", "ciso"]
    timeout: "72h"
```

### 📊 **Quality Gates**

Automated quality enforcement with human oversight:

- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 90% with human review for exceptions
- **Security Scanning**: Zero critical vulnerabilities before deployment
- **Performance**: No degradation beyond defined thresholds
- **Documentation**: Complete coverage of public APIs and user features

## Agent Configuration

### 🔧 **Universal Configuration**

All agents operate based on the project configuration:

```yaml
# .hugai/config.yaml
project:
  name: "my-application"
  technology_stack: "typescript_react_node"
  complexity: "high"
  criticality: "business_critical"
  
agents:
  execution_model: "collaborative"
  governance_level: "balanced"  # minimal, balanced, strict
  parallel_execution: true
  context_sharing: true
  
quality:
  code_coverage_threshold: 90
  security_scan_level: "comprehensive"
  performance_targets: "high"
  documentation_completeness: "full"
```

### 🎛️ **Agent-Specific Configuration**

Each agent can be customized for specific needs:

```yaml
# .hugai/agents/implementation.yaml
implementation_agent:
  languages: ["typescript", "python", "go"]
  frameworks: ["react", "django", "gin"]
  coding_standards: "strict"
  test_generation: true
  documentation_inline: true
