### **Architecture Documentation**

**System Architecture Document**

```markdown
# System Architecture Document

## Executive Summary
This document describes the architecture for a scalable e-commerce platform built using microservices architecture principles.

## Architecture Overview

### Architecture Style
- **Primary Pattern**: Microservices Architecture
- **Communication**: Event-driven with REST APIs
- **Data Management**: Database per service
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Kubernetes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Microservices over Monolith**
   - **Rationale**: Enable independent scaling and development
   - **Trade-offs**: Increased complexity for operational benefits
   - **Validation**: Team experience and infrastructure capability

2. **Event-Driven Communication**
   - **Rationale**: Loose coupling and asynchronous processing
   - **Trade-offs**: Eventual consistency vs immediate consistency
   - **Validation**: Business requirements support eventual consistency

3. **Container Orchestration**
   - **Rationale**: Scalability and operational efficiency
   - **Trade-offs**: Infrastructure complexity vs operational benefits
   - **Validation**: Team has Kubernetes experience

### Quality Attribute Analysis

#### Performance
- **Target**: 200ms response time for 95% of requests
- **Strategy**: Caching, load balancing, database optimization
- **Validation**: Load testing and performance monitoring

#### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scaling based on metrics
- **Data Scaling**: Database sharding and read replicas
- **Geographic Scaling**: Multi-region deployment

#### Security
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit

## Component Design

### Service Boundaries
Services are designed around business capabilities:
- **User Service**: Identity and access management
- **Product Service**: Catalog and inventory
- **Order Service**: Order processing and fulfillment
- **Payment Service**: Payment processing
- **Notification Service**: Communications

### Data Architecture
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
- **Event Sourcing**: For audit trail and state reconstruction
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models for optimization

## Technology Stack

### Backend Services
- **Runtime**: Node.js, Java (Spring Boot)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka
- **API Gateway**: Kong

### Infrastructure
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments
- **Development**: Single replicas, minimal resources
- **Staging**: Production-like configuration
- **Production**: Multi-replica, auto-scaling, multi-AZ

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Source Control**: Git with feature branches
- **Build**: Docker containerization
- **Testing**: Automated unit, integration, and e2e tests
- **Deployment**: Blue-green deployment with rollback capability

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **External Users**: OAuth 2.0 with social providers
- **Internal Services**: Service-to-service authentication
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and input validation

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS for encryption keys
- **Compliance**: GDPR and PCI DSS compliance

## Operational Considerations

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics**: Business and technical metrics collection
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with correlation IDs
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for request flows
- **Alerting**: Proactive alerting on SLA violations

### Disaster Recovery
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups
- **Recovery Time Objective**: 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective**: 1 hour
- **Geographic Redundancy**: Multi-region deployment

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Service Dependencies**: Mitigated with circuit breakers
- **Data Consistency**: Managed with event sourcing
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Addressed with caching and scaling

### Operational Risks
- **Team Learning Curve**: Training and documentation
- **Infrastructure Complexity**: Gradual adoption and automation
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Cloud-agnostic design principles

## Future Roadmap

### Short-term (3-6 months)
- Service mesh adoption evaluation
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
- Performance optimization

### Medium-term (6-12 months)
- Machine learning integration
- Edge computing capabilities
- Advanced security features

### Long-term (12+ months)
- Serverless computing adoption
- Global content distribution
- AI-powered personalization

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Quick Start Checklist**

- [ ] Configure architecture patterns and preferences
- [ ] Define quality attribute priorities
- [ ] Set up technology stack preferences
- [ ] Configure review and approval workflows
- [ ] Prepare requirements and constraints input
- [ ] Set up integration with implementation agents

### **Best Practices**

1. **Start with Quality Attributes**: Define performance, scalability, and security requirements first
2. **Apply Proven Patterns**: Use established architectural patterns appropriate for the domain
3. **Consider Operational Requirements**: Design for monitoring, debugging, and maintenance
4. **Plan for Evolution**: Design architectures that can evolve with changing requirements
5. **Validate Early**: Conduct proof-of-concept implementations for critical decisions

The Architecture Agent ensures that every system is built on a solid, scalable, and maintainable foundation that supports both current needs and future growth.

*Great architecture is invisible to users but essential for developers - invest in getting it right from the start.*
