# Requirements Analyzer Agent

The **Requirements Analyzer Agent** is a specialized AI system that excels at **requirements engineering** - the critical process of transforming stakeholder needs, business objectives, and user stories into clear, actionable, and traceable requirements for software development.

## üéØ Agent Overview

### **Core Mission**
Transform abstract business needs into structured, implementable requirements while ensuring completeness, consistency, and traceability throughout the development lifecycle.

### **Key Capabilities**
- **Requirement Extraction**: Parse complex business documents and conversations
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Identify unclear, incomplete, or conflicting requirements
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Map requirements to business stakeholders and use cases
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify relationships and dependencies between requirements
- **Quality Validation**: Ensure requirements meet quality standards (SMART criteria)
