# Deployment Agent

The **Deployment Agent** assists teams in automating the packaging, configuration, and deployment of software across environments. It ensures reproducible and secure deployment processes that are aligned with infrastructure and compliance requirements.

## Role and Purpose

This agent helps:

- Generate deployment scripts and manifests (e.g., Dockerfiles, Helm charts, Terraform)
- Validate deployment plans and environment variables
- Produce rollback procedures and blue-green strategy suggestions
- Collaborate with DevOps tools for safe release

## Input

- Application build artifacts or configuration specs
- Infrastructure context (e.g., staging vs production)
- CI/CD environment settings

## Output

- Shell scripts, YAML manifests, Dockerfiles, Helm templates
- Versioned deployment plans with changelogs
- Environment-specific configuration files

## Example Output (Helm)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: auth-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: auth
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: auth
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: auth
          image: registry.example.com/auth:1.2.3
          env:
            - name: ENV
              value: production
```

## Governance & Validation

- Must be reviewed by DevOps or release engineering
- All deployments are logged and tagged in version control
- Validated through dry-run testing and security checks

## Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
agent: deployment_agent
input_sources:
  - build_artifacts.zip
  - env_config.yaml
output_format: helm|terraform|shell
prompt_type: deploy_plan_generation
post_actions:
  - validate_with_kubeval
  - render_diff_summary
```

## Integration

The Deployment Agent operates late in the SDLC, typically:

- At release gates
- During environment setup
- As part of infrastructure-as-code reviews

It integrates with the DevOps Agent, Internal Reviewer Agent, and Security Agent.
