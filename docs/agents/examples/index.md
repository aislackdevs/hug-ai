# SAGE Agents — Overview

The **SlackDevs Agentic Governance Engine (SAGE)** consists of specialized AI agents, each responsible for specific aspects of the software development lifecycle (Human Governed AI Development Playbook). These agents collaborate autonomously to deliver high-quality software while maintaining human oversight at critical decision points.

## Universal Agent Architecture

SAGE agents are designed to be:

- **Technology Agnostic**: Work with any programming language, framework, or platform
- **Scalable**: Adapt from solo projects to enterprise-scale developments  
- **Governance-Driven**: Operate under configurable human oversight and approval matrices
- **Quality-Focused**: Implement comprehensive quality gates and validation mechanisms
- **Security-First**: Integrate security best practices throughout the development lifecycle

Requirements → Router → Architect → Implementation → Testing → Security → Performance → Documentation → Review → Integration → DevOps → Deployment
```

### Security-Critical Flow
```text
Requirements → Router → Security → Architect → Implementation → Security → Testing → Performance → Security → Review → DevOps → Deployment
```

### Performance-Critical Flow  
```text
Requirements → Router → Architect → Performance → Implementation → Testing → Performance → Review → DevOps → Performance → Deployment
```

## Governance Integration

All agents operate under the **Human Governed AI Development Playbook Governance Framework** with:

### Quality Gates
- **Requirements Phase**: Business validation, stakeholder sign-off, technical feasibility
- **Architecture Phase**: Security review, scalability assessment, technology validation
- **Implementation Phase**: Code quality, security scanning, test coverage
- **Testing Phase**: Functional completion, performance validation, security testing
- **Security Review**: Vulnerability assessment, compliance validation, privacy review
- **Performance Review**: Load testing, scalability validation, monitoring setup
- **Integration Review**: API validation, end-to-end testing, data flow verification
- **Deployment Review**: Production readiness, rollback validation, support documentation

### Approval Matrix
- **Business Impact**: Product Manager → Business Owner → Executive Sponsor
- **Technical Changes**: Technical Lead → Principal Architect → CTO
- **Security Changes**: Security Engineer → Security Lead → CISO
- **Infrastructure Changes**: DevOps Lead → Infrastructure Architect → VP Engineering

### Human Oversight Checkpoints
- After requirements analysis
- After architecture design  
- After implementation
- After testing completion
- After security review
- After performance validation
- Before infrastructure changes
- After integration testing
- Before production deployment
- After production deployment
