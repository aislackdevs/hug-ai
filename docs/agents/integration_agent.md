# Integration Agent

The **Integration Agent** ensures proper coordination of modules, services, and third-party systems, facilitating smooth end-to-end functionality across the stack.

## Role and Purpose

This agent helps:

- Validate service contracts and API compatibility
- Simulate end-to-end workflows and test integration points
- Detect broken links between internal or external modules
- Recommend data mapping or normalization improvements

## Input

- API specs and module interfaces (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL)
- Service integration guides and architecture outputs
- Mock data and contract definitions

## Output

- Integration test cases and scripts
- Compatibility matrices and coverage reports
- Suggestions for improved data flow or decoupling

## Example Output (YAML)

```yaml
integration_checks:
  - source: auth_service
    target: user_service
    status: passed
    latency: 120ms
  - source: billing_service
    target: payment_gateway
    status: failed
    error: 401 Unauthorized
```

## Governance & Validation

- Integration failures are automatically flagged and logged
- Successful tests must meet latency and error thresholds
- Logs are versioned and optionally exported to monitoring systems

## Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
agent: integration_agent
input_sources:
  - api_specs/*.yaml
  - test_data/**/*.json
  - architecture_outputs/*.md
prompt_type: compatibility+contract_testing
post_actions:
  - run_integration_suite
  - export_logs_to_monitoring
```

## Integration

This agent is typically used:

- Before staging deployments
- When adding or replacing service interfaces
- During regression testing cycles

It coordinates with the Test Agent, Router Agent, and DevOps Agent to ensure production-readiness.
