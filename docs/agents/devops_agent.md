# DevOps Agent

The **DevOps Agent** streamlines the operational backbone of AI-assisted development, integrating automation into infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD pipelines, and observability setups.

## Role and Purpose

This agent helps:

- Scaffold and validate CI/CD pipeline configurations (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Provision infrastructure scripts (Terraform, Pulumi, etc.)
- Configure monitoring and alerting templates
- Suggest improvements based on build/test/deploy history

## Input

- Repository structure and source code
- Project YAML configurations
- Deployment agent outputs and infrastructure policies

## Output

- CI/CD pipeline configuration files (e.g., `.github/workflows/*.yml`)
- Infrastructure templates (e.g., `main.tf`, `pulumi.yaml`)
- Dashboards or metrics setup guides

## Example Output (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18.x'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

## Governance & Validation

- Outputs are reviewed by platform engineers
- Linting, validation, and dry-runs are required before merge
- Secrets and credentials must be externally managed

## Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
agent: devops_agent
input_sources:
  - repo_config.yaml
  - build_spec.yaml
ci_cd_tool: github
infra_tool: terraform
prompt_type: pipeline+infra_provision
post_actions:
  - run_config_linter
  - simulate_pipeline_dryrun
```

## Integration

This agent runs:

- During initial project setup
- Before release cutoffs
- When infrastructure requirements change

It works closely with the Deployment Agent, Security Agent, and Router Agent to maintain a robust devops toolchain.
