# Security Agent

The **Security Agent** is responsible for identifying security risks, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations during the software development lifecycle. It helps maintain secure code and infrastructure by integrating automated security checks into the development workflow.

## Role and Purpose

This agent helps:

- Analyze code for known vulnerabilities and patterns
- Check for insecure dependencies and versions
- Recommend best practices based on OWASP and internal policies
- Generate alerts, remediation suggestions, and audit logs

## Input

- Source code or infrastructure scripts (e.g., IaC)
- Dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`)
- Security policies and compliance constraints

## Output

- Vulnerability reports
- Remediation suggestions or patches
- Annotated code diffs (optional)
- YAML-based security checklist or scan summary

## Example Output (YAML)

```yaml
vulnerabilities:
  - id: SEC-012
    location: src/auth/login.js
    issue: Insecure password comparison
    recommendation: Use constant-time comparison function
    severity: high
```

## Governance & Validation

- All findings must be reviewed by a human security lead
- Integrated with CI/CD pipeline scanners (e.g., Semgrep, Snyk, Trivy)
- False positives are tracked and documented

## Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
agent: security_agent
input_sources:
  - src/**/*.js
  - terraform/**/*.tf
  - policies/security_baseline.md
tools:
  - semgrep
  - snyk
prompt_type: static_analysis+policy_enforcement
post_actions:
  - generate_security_report
  - tag_severity_levels
```

## Integration

This agent can be invoked:

- During code reviews
- Before deployment approval
- In scheduled compliance audits

It connects to the DevOps pipeline and the Internal Reviewer Agent for full traceability.
