# Implementation Process

The **Implementation Process** is where design specifications are transformed into functioning software components. This phase emphasizes quality, speed, and alignment with architectural standards â€” assisted by generative AI agents.

## Objectives

- Develop functional and testable modules based on validated designs
- Enforce project coding standards and structure
- Integrate inline documentation and automated testing early

## Key Activities

- Code generation via Implementation Agent
- Manual coding and scaffolding by developers
- Inline documentation and test generation
- Code review and refactoring cycles

## Inputs

- Architecture specs and interface definitions
- `requirements.yaml`
- Coding standards and templates

## Outputs

- Source code and test files
- Git-tracked commits with summaries
- Updated documentation (optional)

## Tools & Agents

- Implementation Agent
- Prompt Refiner Agent
- Test Agent (immediately after implementation)
- Internal Reviewer Agent

## Governance Practices

- All generated code must be reviewed by a developer
- CI pipelines ensure style, lint, and test compliance
- Prompts and configs are versioned with the repository

## Integration with Lifecycle

The Implementation Process feeds into:

- Testing and validation
- Deployment pipelines
- Documentation publishing workflows

## Best Practices

- Treat generated code as a draft, not a final artifact
- Use pair programming or human-in-the-loop practices
- Include tests and comments with every pull request
