# Design Process

The **Design Process** transforms validated requirements into technical blueprints that guide implementation. This phase ensures alignment across architecture, system behavior, and integration needs.

## Objectives

- Translate functional and non-functional requirements into design artifacts
- Define architectural modules, data flows, and interfaces
- Ensure technical feasibility and consistency across the system

## Key Activities

### 1. Architecture Design
- Architecture proposal generation (via Architecture Agent)
- Human-led validation of suggested designs
- Technical stack selection and evaluation
- Component identification and boundary definition

### 2. Detailed Design
- Data modeling and database schema design
- API design and interface definitions
- User interface wireframes and mockups
- Security architecture and controls design

### 3. Design Validation
- Architecture review and evaluation
- Design prototyping for critical components
- Requirements-to-design traceability verification
- Design quality assessment and optimization

### 4. Documentation
- Diagram generation (C4, sequence, component)
- Documentation of system and module-level behaviors
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Implementation guidelines and standards

## Inputs

- `requirements.yaml` from Planning
- Technical constraints and style guides
- Previous system architectures (if evolving an existing app)

## Outputs

- Architecture specs (`architecture.md` or YAML)
- Design diagrams and documentation stubs
- Integration and module interface definitions
- Design review checklist outcomes

## Tools & Agents

### AI-Powered Tools
- **Architecture Agent**: Generates architecture proposals and patterns
- **Design Validator**: Analyzes designs for common issues and quality
- **Diagram Generator**: Creates visual representations of system design
- **API Generator**: Creates API specifications from requirements
- **Security Analyzer**: Identifies security considerations in design
- **Traceability Mapper**: Links requirements to design elements

### Supporting Agents
- **Prompt Refiner Agent**: Optimizes AI prompts for design tasks
- **Internal Reviewer Agent**: Reviews design specifications (optional)
- **Code Example Generator**: Creates implementation examples

### Human Contributors
- Senior architects and technical leads
- Domain experts and subject matter experts
- UI/UX designers and user experience specialists

## Governance Practices

- Architecture specs must be reviewed by a senior engineer
- Diagrams must follow visual consistency guidelines
- Version-controlled artifacts for traceability and reuse

## Integration with Lifecycle

The Design Process feeds into:

- Implementation phase (with scoped designs)
- Security validation (based on data flows and modules)
- Integration test planning

## Best Practices

### Design Quality
- Prioritize clarity and modularity in design
- Include edge case handling in flow definitions
- Maintain design artifacts as living documents throughout the project
- Define architecture quality attributes explicitly
- Create architecture test cases to validate designs

### Human-AI Collaboration
- Establish clear roles for humans and AI in design
- Use AI for initial design generation and validation
- Reserve critical design decisions for human expertise
- Create feedback loops to improve AI design contributions

### Design Communication
- Use AI to generate design visualizations for stakeholders
- Create multiple views of architecture for different audiences
- Maintain consistent terminology and notation across artifacts
- Document trade-offs and constraints in architectural decisions

### Design Governance
- Establish design review procedures for AI-generated designs
- Create design standards and guidelines for AI to follow
- Implement version control for all design artifacts
- Maintain design decision records with clear rationales

## Design Artifacts

### Key Documentation

| Artifact | Purpose | AI Enhancement |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Architecture Overview | Describes high-level system structure | AI generates architecture diagrams and suggests patterns |
| Component Specifications | Details each component's functionality | AI ensures comprehensive specifications with consistent detail |
| Data Models | Defines data structures and relationships | AI optimizes schema design and identifies potential issues |
| API Documentation | Describes system interfaces | AI generates OpenAPI/Swagger specifications automatically |
| UI Specifications | Details user interface elements and behavior | AI suggests UI components based on requirements |
| Security Design | Documents security controls and measures | AI identifies security concerns and suggests mitigations |
| Design Decision Log | Records key design decisions and rationales | AI helps evaluate alternatives and document trade-offs |

### Design Notations and Models

- **UML Diagrams**: Class, sequence, component, and deployment diagrams
- **Entity-Relationship Diagrams**: Data model visualization
- **API Specifications**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Wireframes and Mockups**: UI design visualizations
- **Architecture Decision Records**: Structured documentation of decisions

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Design-Requirement Alignment | Percentage of requirements addressed in design | 100% |
| Design Review Effectiveness | Percentage of issues identified in design review vs. implementation | >80% |
| Design Stability | Frequency of major design changes during implementation | <10% significant changes |
| Documentation Completeness | Coverage of design elements in documentation | >95% documented |
| Design Efficiency | Time from requirements approval to design completion | 30% faster than traditional design |
| AI Contribution Value | Developer rating of AI design contributions | >4/5 average rating |

## Transitioning to Implementation

The design phase prepares for implementation by providing:

1. **Architecture Blueprint**: Clear system structure that guides implementation
2. **Component Specifications**: Detailed component functionality and interfaces
3. **Technical Standards**: Consistent coding standards and patterns
4. **Implementation Guidelines**: Practical guidance for developers
5. **Design Validation**: Confidence that the design addresses requirements

### Transition Checklist
- [ ] Architecture reviewed and approved by technical stakeholders
- [ ] Component specifications detailed and validated
- [ ] API contracts defined and documented
- [ ] Security design reviewed and approved
- [ ] Implementation guidelines and standards established
- [ ] Design artifacts properly versioned and accessible
- [ ] Handoff documentation prepared for development teams

The transition should include design handoff sessions with implementation teams, creation of initial implementation tasks, and establishment of design consultation protocols for implementation questions.
