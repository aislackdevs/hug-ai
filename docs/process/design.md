# Design Process

The **Design Process** transforms validated requirements into technical blueprints that guide implementation. This phase ensures alignment across architecture, system behavior, and integration needs.

## Objectives

- Translate functional and non-functional requirements into design artifacts
- Define architectural modules, data flows, and interfaces
- Ensure technical feasibility and consistency across the system

## Key Activities

- Architecture proposal generation (via Architecture Agent)
- Human-led validation of suggested designs
- Diagram generation (C4, sequence, component)
- Documentation of system and module-level behaviors

## Inputs

- `requirements.yaml` from Planning
- Technical constraints and style guides
- Previous system architectures (if evolving an existing app)

## Outputs

- Architecture specs (`architecture.md` or YAML)
- Design diagrams and documentation stubs
- Integration and module interface definitions
- Design review checklist outcomes

## Tools & Agents

- Architecture Agent
- Prompt Refiner Agent
- Internal Reviewer Agent (optional, for spec review)

## Governance Practices

- Architecture specs must be reviewed by a senior engineer
- Diagrams must follow visual consistency guidelines
- Version-controlled artifacts for traceability and reuse

## Integration with Lifecycle

The Design Process feeds into:

- Implementation phase (with scoped designs)
- Security validation (based on data flows and modules)
- Integration test planning

## Best Practices

- Prioritize clarity and modularity in design
- Include edge case handling in flow definitions
- Maintain design artifacts as living documents throughout the project
