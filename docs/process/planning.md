# Planning Process

The **Planning Process** is the first and foundational phase of the HUG AI lifecycle. It combines human insight and AI support to define goals, requirements, and constraints that guide the entire development effort.

## Objectives

- Align business objectives with technical outcomes
- Identify and refine system requirements
- Surface risks, constraints, and dependencies
- Prepare input artifacts for design and architecture

## Key Activities

### 1. Project Initialization
- Stakeholder interviews and requirement gathering
- Vision workshop to establish project objectives
- Scope definition and boundary setting
- Team formation and role definition

### 2. Requirements Analysis
- AI-assisted clarification of user stories or transcripts
- Requirements validation via the Requirements Analyzer Agent
- Dependency identification and conflict analysis
- Requirements prioritization and impact assessment

### 3. Documentation and Planning
- Output structuring into YAML and documentation-ready formats
- Backlog creation and roadmap development
- Resource planning and timeline estimation
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning

## Inputs

- Business goals and success metrics
- User stories, transcripts, or whiteboard notes
- Existing system documentation (if applicable)
- Context files (e.g., personas, compliance, security constraints)

## Outputs

- Structured `requirements.yaml`
- Clarification questions for stakeholders
- Draft backlog and epics
- Artifacts tagged by risk, priority, and scope

## Tools & Agents

### AI-Powered Tools
- **Requirements Analyzer Agent**: Validates requirements for quality, consistency, and completeness
- **Prompt Refiner Agent**: Optimizes prompts for AI-assisted analysis (optional)
- **Estimation Assistant**: Predicts effort based on similar historical work
- **Dependency Mapper**: Identifies and visualizes requirements dependencies
- **Risk Predictor**: Flags potential risks based on project characteristics

### Human Contributors
- Product owners and business analysts
- Domain experts and stakeholders
- Technical architects and senior developers

## Governance Practices

- Human review of all extracted requirements
- Version control of requirement files
- Use of templates and checklists for completeness

## Integration with Lifecycle

The Planning Process feeds directly into:

- Design phase (via architecture specs)
- Implementation (via scoped requirements)
- Governance reviews (via traceable context)

## Best Practices

### Requirements Quality
- Use AI to clarify, not replace, human intention
- Keep requirements atomic and testable
- Validate each requirement with at least one stakeholder
- Maintain traceability between requirements and their sources
- Establish clear criteria for high-quality requirements

### Stakeholder Engagement
- Maintain regular stakeholder involvement throughout planning
- Use AI to prepare stakeholder-friendly progress updates
- Create feedback loops for stakeholder input on AI contributions
- Validate AI-generated planning artifacts with stakeholders

### AI Integration Planning
- Define boundaries of AI autonomy for each development activity
- Establish protocols for reviewing and accepting AI contributions
- Create fallback plans for scenarios where AI assistance is insufficient
- Document all AI contributions with proper attribution

### Documentation Standards
- Follow established documentation templates and formats
- Ensure version control of all requirement artifacts
- Maintain clear separation between human and AI inputs
- Use consistent terminology and notation across documents

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Requirements Quality Score | Measure of clarity, testability, and completeness | >85% |
| Stakeholder Alignment | Degree of agreement among stakeholders on project vision | >90% agreement |
| Planning Efficiency | Time from project initiation to approved plan | 25% faster than traditional planning |
| Requirement Stability | Frequency of major requirement changes after approval | <15% change after baseline |
| AI Contribution Value | Stakeholder rating of AI contributions to planning | >4/5 average rating |

## Transitioning to Design

The planning phase sets the foundation for the design phase by providing:

1. **Clear Requirements**: Well-defined requirements that guide design decisions
2. **Project Boundaries**: Established scope that defines design constraints
3. **Prioritized Backlog**: Ordered list of features to inform design sequencing
4. **Technical Direction**: High-level architecture to guide detailed design
5. **Success Criteria**: Clear metrics to evaluate design against

### Transition Checklist
- [ ] Requirements validated and approved by stakeholders
- [ ] Project scope and boundaries clearly defined
- [ ] Technical feasibility assessed and documented
- [ ] Resource allocation and timeline established
- [ ] Risk assessment completed and mitigation planned
- [ ] Handoff documentation prepared for design team

The transition should include a formal review of planning artifacts and explicit acceptance criteria for moving to the next phase. AI assistants can help validate readiness by checking planning completeness and identifying unresolved issues.
