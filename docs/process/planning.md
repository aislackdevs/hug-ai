# Planning Process

The **Planning Process** is the first and foundational phase of the HUG AI lifecycle. It combines human insight and AI support to define goals, requirements, and constraints that guide the entire development effort.

## Objectives

- Align business objectives with technical outcomes
- Identify and refine system requirements
- Surface risks, constraints, and dependencies
- Prepare input artifacts for design and architecture

## Key Activities

- Stakeholder interviews and requirement gathering
- AI-assisted clarification of user stories or transcripts
- Requirements validation via the Requirements Analyzer Agent
- Output structuring into YAML and documentation-ready formats

## Inputs

- Business goals and success metrics
- User stories, transcripts, or whiteboard notes
- Existing system documentation (if applicable)
- Context files (e.g., personas, compliance, security constraints)

## Outputs

- Structured `requirements.yaml`
- Clarification questions for stakeholders
- Draft backlog and epics
- Artifacts tagged by risk, priority, and scope

## Tools & Agents

- Requirements Analyzer Agent
- Prompt Refiner Agent (optional)
- Manual input from product owners or analysts

## Governance Practices

- Human review of all extracted requirements
- Version control of requirement files
- Use of templates and checklists for completeness

## Integration with Lifecycle

The Planning Process feeds directly into:

- Design phase (via architecture specs)
- Implementation (via scoped requirements)
- Governance reviews (via traceable context)

## Best Practices

- Use AI to clarify, not replace, human intention
- Keep requirements atomic and testable
- Validate each requirement with at least one stakeholder
