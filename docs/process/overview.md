# Process Overview

HUG AI defines a structured, repeatable software development lifecycle (SDLC) enhanced with AI agents and governed by human oversight.

Each phase of the process includes clearly scoped roles for agents, checkpoints for human validation, and tooling recommendations.

## Key Development Phases

- **[Planning](planning.md)**: Convert goals into requirements, risks, and scoped tasks
- **[Design](design.md)**: Define architecture, components, and data flow
- **[Implementation](implementation.md)**: Generate and review code collaboratively with agents
- **[Testing](testing.md)**: Ensure quality, performance, and security
- **[Deployment](deployment.md)**: Automate safe and observable delivery
- **[Maintenance](maintenance.md)**: Keep systems healthy and continuously improved

### Phase Overview

| Phase | Primary Focus | Key AI Agents | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| [Planning](planning.md) | Requirements gathering and project definition | Requirements Analyzer, Estimation Assistant | Clear requirements with >85% quality score |
| [Design](design.md) | Architecture and system design | Architecture Agent, Design Validator | 100% requirement coverage in design |
| [Implementation](implementation.md) | Code development and quality assurance | Implementation Agent, Code Analyzer | 30% faster development with quality gates |
| [Testing](testing.md) | Quality validation and verification | Test Agent, Performance Analyzer | >90% test coverage with <5% defect leakage |
| [Deployment](deployment.md) | Production delivery and monitoring | Deployment Agent, Risk Predictor | >98% deployment success rate |
| [Maintenance](maintenance.md) | Operations and continuous improvement | Maintenance Agent, Anomaly Detector | >99.9% uptime with efficient operations |

## How It Works

Each process document includes:
- Inputs and outputs
- Agent orchestration logic
- Review guidelines and governance hooks
- Diagrams and configuration templates (where available)

## Lifecycle Coordination

HUG AI is not linear â€” processes can be:
- Iterated rapidly with agents
- Escalated or retried with fallback logic
- Paired with reviews or security validations at any point

## Example Tools

- Requirements Analyzer Agent
- Architecture Agent
- Test Agent
- Deployment Agent
- Maintenance Agent
