# Maintenance Process

The **Maintenance Process** ensures the long-term reliability, security, and usability of software systems post-deployment. It involves proactive and reactive tasks to prevent degradation and support evolving needs.

## Objectives

- Address technical debt and outdated dependencies
- Maintain documentation and knowledge parity
- Track and respond to bugs, incidents, and feedback

## Key Activities

- Scheduled audits and dependency checks
- Regeneration of outdated documentation
- Refactor suggestions from Maintenance Agent
- Issue triage and ticket generation for known gaps

## Inputs

- Runtime monitoring data and user feedback
- Source code and historical change logs
- Documentation aging metrics

## Outputs

- Maintenance reports and version bump proposals
- Task backlog for technical debt reduction
- Documentation updates and changelogs

## Tools & Agents

- Maintenance Agent
- Documentation Writer Agent
- Internal Reviewer Agent (for refactors)

## Governance Practices

- Maintenance reports reviewed during sprint planning
- Refactor work treated as first-class citizen in agile boards
- Metrics tracked for aging, coverage, and relevance

## Integration with Lifecycle

This phase supports:

- Continuous improvement cycles
- Long-term support (LTS) strategies
- Pre-audit preparation for regulated systems

## Best Practices

- Schedule maintenance as part of every sprint
- Don’t defer small fixes — they compound
- Use metrics to prioritize maintenance with business value
