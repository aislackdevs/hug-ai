# Testing Process

The **Testing Process** ensures software reliability, correctness, and stability through automated and human-guided validations across all system layers.

## Objectives

- Verify functional and non-functional requirements
- Achieve high test coverage across components and workflows
- Ensure regression safety and change resilience

## Key Activities

- Unit and integration test generation (via Test Agent)
- Manual test design for edge or exploratory cases
- Coverage analysis and benchmark validation
- Defect triage and remediation loops

## Inputs

- Source code and component specifications
- Design artifacts and acceptance criteria
- Test frameworks and coverage tools

## Outputs

- Test suites (unit, integration, regression)
- Coverage and performance reports
- QA logs and issue tracking updates

## Tools & Agents

- Test Agent
- Performance Agent (optional)
- Security Agent (for validation context)
- Manual QA input or test case design

## Governance Practices

- All tests tracked in version control
- Minimum coverage thresholds enforced via CI/CD
- Failing tests block merges in protected branches

## Integration with Lifecycle

The Testing Process connects to:

- Implementation and deployment validations
- Integration and staging environments
- Continuous improvement feedback loops

## Best Practices

- Write tests before or alongside implementation (TDD-compatible)
- Use AI to suggest edge cases, but validate manually
- Incorporate test review in PR checklists
