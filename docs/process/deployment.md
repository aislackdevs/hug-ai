# Deployment Process

The **Deployment Process** handles the packaging, configuration, and delivery of applications to target environments. It ensures reproducibility, traceability, and minimal downtime across releases.

## Objectives

- Automate and standardize deployment tasks
- Enable secure, consistent environment provisioning
- Support rollback and disaster recovery strategies

## Key Activities

- Generate deployment manifests (via Deployment Agent)
- Run pre-deployment validations and security scans
- Execute environment-specific deployment strategies (e.g., blue/green, canary)
- Log and version each release artifact

## Inputs

- Built and tested code from CI/CD pipelines
- Configuration files and secrets (managed securely)
- Deployment scripts, containers, or manifests

## Outputs

- Live application instances or services
- Logs of deployments with versions and changesets
- Post-deployment health checks and monitoring integrations

## Tools & Agents

- Deployment Agent
- DevOps Agent
- Security Agent (for runtime validation)

## Governance Practices

- Deployment approvals gated by human reviewers and tests
- Secrets never stored in code; use secure vaults
- CI/CD must log timestamps, changes, and outcomes

## Integration with Lifecycle

The Deployment Process bridges:

- Implementation and monitoring
- QA and production environments
- Maintenance and rollback agents

## Best Practices

- Automate everything, but monitor key metrics manually
- Test deployment in staging before pushing to production
- Maintain parity between staging and prod environments
