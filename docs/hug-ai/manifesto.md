# HUG AI Manifesto

The **Human-Governed AI Software Development (HUG AI)** Manifesto defines the core values and principles guiding our methodology. It emphasizes collaboration, responsibility, and augmentation over replacement.

## Core Beliefs

- **AI should enhance, not replace, human judgment.**
- **Developers remain accountable for quality, ethics, and outcomes.**
- **Transparency and traceability are non-negotiable.**
- **We value augmentation, not automation without oversight.**
- **Continuous improvement applies to both humans and agents.**

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Human-in-the-Loop by Default
Every decision made or suggested by AI must pass through human validation — especially in critical, ethical, or security-sensitive contexts.

### 2. Context-Aware Prompting
AI outputs are only as reliable as their inputs. Structured prompts, context files, and shared knowledge bases must be maintained and versioned.

### 3. Transparent Agent Chains
Each agent’s action must be logged, auditable, and explainable. Chains of responsibility must be evident in both process and code.

### 4. Role-Based Governance
AI tasks should mirror human roles (e.g., reviewer, implementer) and report accordingly. Every output must be tied to accountable human reviewers.

### 5. Evolvable Tooling
The methodology should evolve as tools improve. Prompting patterns, evaluation strategies, and review processes must be adaptable and open to iteration.

### 6. Open Standards and Knowledge Sharing
AI-generated assets, patterns, and methods must be documented and, where possible, shared openly to foster a global community of responsible developers.

## Our Commitment

We believe in a future where developers embrace AI as partners — not competitors — and where software is built faster, better, and more ethically because of that partnership.

The HUG AI Manifesto is a living document. As tools, challenges, and communities evolve, so will our shared understanding of responsible AI development.
