# What is HUG AI?

**HUG AI** stands for **Human-Governed AI Software Development**.  
It is a methodology designed to integrate artificial intelligence tools into software development workflows without giving up human control over decisions, architecture, quality, and responsibility.

## Why "HUG"?

The name reflects our belief: AI doesn't replace developers — it **enhances** them.  
AI can generate code, but humans design it, review it, understand it, and make it trustworthy.

"HUG" also expresses our attitude toward AI:

- We don't fear it — we embrace it.  
- We don't let it run alone — we guide it.  
- We don't trust it blindly — we audit it.

## Purpose

HUG AI is the result of years of experimenting with AI-assisted workflows combined with professional engineering standards. It is meant to:

- Standardize how teams collaborate with AI.
- Accelerate delivery without sacrificing quality.
- Introduce modular, specialized AI agents in development.
- Maintain traceability, version control, and accountability.

## What makes it different?

- **Human-governed at every step**: humans guide and validate AI output.
- **Multi-agent architecture**: each AI agent has a clear, specialized role.
- **Modular and auditable**: generated code is versionable and reviewable.
- **Productivity with control**: speed and precision, without chaos.

## What does it include?

- A full development lifecycle adapted to AI usage.
- YAML-based flows and templates for structured automation.
- Clear rules for deploying and coordinating AI agents.
- Best practices for testing, documentation, and deployment with AI.

## Who is it for?

- Tech leads scaling teams with responsible AI integration.
- Developers curious about coding with AI assistance.
- Product teams seeking speed without losing oversight.
- Organizations with compliance, security, or governance requirements.
