# HUG AI Development Flows

## Overview

HUG AI Development implements structured, traceable workflows where specialized AI agents collaborate through a well-defined Software Development Life Cycle. This approach ensures **human governance at every step** while maintaining development velocity and quality.

## Core Agent Flow

The default HUG AI development flow follows this agent orchestration pipeline:

    A[Prompt Refiner] --> B[Requirements Analyzer]
    B --> C[Router] 
    C --> D[Architecture]
    D --> E[Implementation]
    E --> F[Testing]
    F --> G[Documentation]
    G --> H[Internal Reviewer]
    H --> I[Branch/PR Manager]
    I --> J[Maintenance]

    style F fill:#fff3e0
    style I fill:#c8e6c9
    style J fill:#ffebee
```

### Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Phase | Core Function |
|-------|--------|---------------|

## Human Governance Checkpoints

### What are Checkpoints?

Checkpoints are strategic pause points in the development flow where AI agents **wait for human validation** before proceeding. This enables:

- **Interactive Learning**: Understand AI decision-making processes
- **Expert Guidance**: Inject human insight and domain expertise
- **Quality Control**: Prevent undesired outputs early in the process
- **Compliance Assurance**: Maintain regulatory and organizational requirements

### Checkpoint Configuration

Configure checkpoints using the `.hugai/flow.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
# .hugai/flow.yaml
project:
  name: "my-application"
  
governance:
  checkpoints:
    # Planning phase checkpoints
    after_requirements_analysis: true
    after_architecture_design: true
    
    # Implementation phase checkpoints
    after_code_implementation: false
    after_testing_completion: true
    
    # Review and deployment checkpoints
    after_code_review: true
    before_pr_creation: true
    before_deployment: true
    
  approval_workflows:
    requirements_changes:
      approvers: ["product-manager", "business-analyst"]
      timeout: "24h"
      
    architecture_changes:
      approvers: ["tech-lead", "principal-architect"]
      timeout: "48h"
      
    security_changes:
      approvers: ["security-lead", "ciso"]
      timeout: "72h"
      
    production_deployment:
      approvers: ["tech-lead", "devops-lead", "product-manager"]
      timeout: "24h"

# Team-specific configurations
team:
  experience_level: "intermediate"  # beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert
  governance_style: "balanced"      # minimal, balanced, strict
  automation_preference: "high"     # low, medium, high
```

### Dynamic Checkpoint Adaptation

HUG AI can automatically adjust checkpoints based on:

- **Team Experience**: More experienced teams get fewer checkpoints
- **Project Risk**: Higher risk projects require more governance
- **Change Impact**: Significant changes trigger additional checkpoints
- **Historical Performance**: Teams with good track records get more autonomy

## Best Practices

### Checkpoint Design Principles

1. **Strategic Placement**: Position checkpoints at natural decision points
2. **Clear Context**: Provide sufficient information for human reviewers
3. **Actionable Options**: Enable clear approve/reject/modify decisions
4. **Time-bounded**: Set reasonable timeouts to prevent bottlenecks
5. **Escalation Paths**: Define clear escalation for timeout scenarios

### Team Adoption Guidelines

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with more checkpoints and reduce gradually
2. **Team-specific**: Customize flows based on team experience and preferences
3. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess and optimize checkpoint effectiveness
4. **Metrics-driven**: Use flow analytics to guide optimization decisions
5. **Change Management**: Implement flow changes gradually with team input

### Governance Balance

- **Too Few Checkpoints**: Risk of AI errors and compliance issues
- **Too Many Checkpoints**: Reduced velocity and team frustration
- **Optimal Balance**: Checkpoints that add value without hindering productivity
