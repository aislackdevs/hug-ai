# About HUG AI

HUG AI stands for **Human-Governed AI Software Development** — a methodology born out of real-world experimentation, technical collaboration, and a shared mission to combine the power of AI with the judgment and responsibility of human developers.

This playbook is the result of over two years of practical work with AI-assisted coding, cross-functional development teams, and evolving workflows in real business environments.

## Who created it?

The methodology was developed by **SlackDevs**, a network of developers and engineers passionate about building sustainable, transparent, and scalable AI-powered software systems.

We’ve worked with multiple organizations to prototype, validate, and refine this approach, blending industry best practices with generative AI capabilities.

## Why did we create this?

We observed two polarized narratives in the industry:

- One side claimed AI was nowhere near ready to assist with real software engineering.
- The other argued developers would soon be replaced entirely.

HUG AI takes the middle path — a **pragmatic, structured, human-centered approach** to AI collaboration in code.

Our key beliefs:

- AI should speed up delivery, not erase accountability.
- Developers should lead the process, not chase AI outputs.
- Governance and documentation are not optional — they’re part of what makes code reliable and production-ready.

## What’s the long-term vision?

This project aims to:

- Provide a clear structure for **AI-assisted software development**.
- Define reusable agent roles, processes, and YAML-based configurations.
- Help teams **embrace AI safely**, without chaos or dependency.
- Support open collaboration across organizations working with AI tools.

## Want to get involved?

We're continuously evolving the playbook. Contributions, feedback, and collaboration are welcome. Reach out through SlackDevs channels or submit an issue or pull request once this framework goes live as an open project.
