# Guides Overview

The **HUG AI Guides** section provides hands-on, applied documentation to help teams use the methodology in practical scenarios.

These guides are not theoreticalâ€”they are built from the real use of HUG AI across multiple companies, teams, and AI-assisted development workflows.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Execution Blueprints**: Step-by-step flows for running agent-based development.
- **Agent Operation Manuals**: How to configure and trigger agents effectively.
- **Human Oversight Roles**: How developers, architects, and product leads work with AI.
- **Governance Protocols**: How to review, approve, and trace agent outputs.
- **Project Templates**: Starting points for real-world use (coming soon).

## Intended Audience

This section is designed for:
- Team leads and AI advocates piloting HUG AI
- Developers integrating agents into workflows
- Architects building reusable prompt templates
- Product owners defining SDLC policies and checkpoints

## Coming Soon

We will continue publishing:
- Advanced CI/CD integration guides
- Platform-specific extensions (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, SlackOps)
- Agent orchestration recipes with fallback, retry, and role-switch logic

Stay tuned or contribute directly.
