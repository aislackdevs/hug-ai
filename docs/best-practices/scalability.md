- **Organizational**: Team workflows, branching strategies, agent roles
- **Process**: Reusability of prompts, modular artifacts, and templates

## Design Strategies

### 1. Modular Architecture

- Centralize prompt scaffolds in a shared registry

### 4. Reusable Agents
- Deploy agents in a way that supports horizontal scaling
- Tag and isolate long-running or stateful agents

## Development Patterns

- Use feature flags and toggles to scale releases
- Tag AI-generated code with metadata for filtering or cleanup
- Include scaling tests as part of performance validation

## Governance Implications

- As team size grows, enforce branching and PR rules via the Branch & PR Manager Agent
