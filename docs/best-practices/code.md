In HUG AI, code quality is a shared responsibility between AI agents and human developers. AI can scaffold and accelerate code creation, but humans are accountable for clarity, maintainability, and correctness.

## Principles of Code Quality

- **Readability**: Code must be easy to understand for current and future contributors.
- **Consistency**: Naming, structure, and patterns should follow shared conventions.
- **Testability**: Every module should be verifiable through automated tests.
- **Traceability**: Code origins, including AI involvement, must be documented.

## AI-Specific Guidelines

- Review AI-generated code as you would code from a junior developer.
- Use versioned prompt templates to ensure consistency in generation.
- Prefer composable, small functions over monolithic blocks.

## Practices to Apply

### 1. Code Reviews with AI Context
- Use Internal Reviewer Agent for first-pass assessments
- Annotate reviews with agent prompt metadata

### 2. Style Guide Enforcement
- Apply linters and formatters in CI
- Align all agents to a central style guide (e.g., `coding_standards.md`)

### 3. Refactoring and Cleanup
- Refactor code post-generation before merging
- Use Maintenance Agent to identify duplication or anti-patterns

### 4. Commit Hygiene
- Include clear, scoped commits
- Log when code is AI-generated, edited, or manually written

### 5. Documentation Inclusion
- Inline docstrings and module-level comments are required
- Encourage agents to generate usage examples and context explanations

## Integration Points

- Implementation Agent: Generates code based on specs
- Internal Reviewer Agent: Flags quality issues pre-merge
- Test Agent: Validates coverage and input/output expectations

## Remember

AI can accelerate code writing, but cannot (yet) guarantee quality. That’s the human’s role — and a core tenet of HUG AI.
