In HUG AI, security is embedded across the lifecycle — not postponed to the end. AI-augmented development must be paired with rigorous security governance and automated validation.

## Key Focus Areas

- **Code Security**: Prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, misuse of secrets)
- **Prompt Security**: Ensure AI prompts do not leak data or generate risky content
- **Environment Security**: Protect infrastructure, deployment, and agent execution layers

## Core Practices

### 1. Secure Prompting Patterns
- Avoid including secrets or credentials in context
- Use placeholder tokens or vault references (e.g., `{{API_KEY}}`)
- Redact sensitive outputs or flag them with tags like `pii_sensitive`

### 2. Static and Dynamic Code Scanning
- Run scans after code is generated and before merge
- Flag use of deprecated or insecure APIs
- Integrate scanners into CI (e.g., Bandit, Semgrep, Trivy)

### 3. Threat Modeling and Data Flows
- Use the Architecture Agent to visualize data movement
- Identify attack surfaces and trust boundaries early
- Use diagrams in design reviews to assess risks

### 4. Secrets Management
- Never hardcode secrets in AI inputs or outputs
- Use secret managers (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Tag code that interacts with secrets for extra validation

### 5. Agent Validation and Scope Control
- Limit agent permissions to scoped actions
- Log and audit agent behaviors (especially retries and escalations)
- Avoid agent chains that bypass human review in security-critical flows

## Agents Involved

- **Security Agent**: Runs scans, enforces policy prompts
- **Architecture Agent**: Models security-related design choices
- **Router Agent**: Controls flow when security risk is detected

## Governance

- All security-related code must be reviewed by trained developers
- Security incidents or findings must be logged and resolved in the same sprint
- Compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) must be encoded into prompt context

## Example Configuration

```yaml
agent: security_agent
input:
  - generated_code/**/*.py
  - requirements.yaml
  - deployment.yaml
checks:
  - static_analysis
  - secret_detection
  - dependency_vulnerability_check
post_actions:
  - alert_if_high_risk
  - block_ci_on_fail
```
