2. **Start small**: Begin with one or two agents in well-defined areas
3. **Configure context**: Set up proper context sources for your project
4. **Establish feedback**: Create clear feedback mechanisms for agent improvement
5. **Monitor usage**: Track performance, effectiveness, and costs
6. **Iterate**: Refine agent configurations based on team feedback and metrics
