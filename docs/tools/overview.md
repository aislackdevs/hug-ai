# Tools Overview

This section collects the configuration assets, templates, and foundational tooling required to use the HUG AI methodology in production environments.

It defines how teams can standardize agent usage, style compliance, and workflow automation.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Coding Style Guides**: Standard naming, formatting, and linting rules
- **Prompt Templates**: Reusable, versioned prompt scaffolds for all agent roles
- **Agent Registry**: Central config for managing agents across a repo or organization
- **Orchestration Tools**: Workflow helpers to connect and supervise agent chains
- **Configuration Examples**: YAML blocks and folder structures to bootstrap your setup

## Principles

All tooling in HUG AI is:
- **Open**: Fully inspectable and auditable
- **Composable**: Works modularly with human checkpoints
- **Versioned**: Stored alongside code in source control

## Tool Consumers

These tools are useful for:
- Developers running agents locally
- CI/CD teams integrating agents into pipelines
- Prompt engineers standardizing generation
- Reviewers validating outputs and changelogs

## Note

This section will grow with community contributions and evolving best practices.
