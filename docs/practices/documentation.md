# Documentation Best Practices

Documentation is essential to ensuring that AI-assisted development remains transparent, maintainable, and accessible across contributors.

In HUG AI, documentation is:
- **Integrated** with every phase of the lifecycle
- **Generated** in part by agents, but curated by humans
- **Versioned** alongside code and prompt artifacts

## Key Documentation Types

| Type              | Description                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Requirements      | Structured functional and non-functional goals   |
| Architecture      | Component maps, interfaces, and design rationale |
| Implementation    | Inline comments, module READMEs                  |
| Tests             | Coverage rationale and test intent               |
| Deployment        | Environment configs, runbooks, rollback plans    |

## Documentation Agents

- **Requirements Analyzer Agent**: Produces structured specs
- **Architecture Agent**: Outputs diagrams and architecture notes
- **Documentation Writer Agent**: Generates summaries, READMEs, and docstrings

## Best Practices

### 1. Docs as First-Class Artifacts
- Store in `docs/` or inline with modules
- Version in the same repo as the code
- Use `.md` for narrative + `.yaml` for structured assets

### 2. Auto-Generate, Then Edit
- Let agents generate initial versions
- Human reviewers revise, expand, or refactor
- Use review checklists to validate completeness

### 3. Use Style and Structure Standards
- Enforce consistent headers, lists, code blocks
- Use MkDocs Material reference elements (e.g. `!!! note`, `=== tabs`)
- Tag docs by lifecycle phase and component

### 4. Maintain Living Docs
- Refresh during maintenance sprints
- Detect stale or unused documentation with the Maintenance Agent

## Governance

- Changes to documentation must go through PR process
- Reviewers validate consistency, scope, and clarity
- Docs impacting compliance (e.g., data flows) require signoff

## Example Integration

```yaml
agent: documentation_writer_agent
input:
  - implementation_notes.md
  - architecture.yaml
output:
  - README.md
  - usage_examples.md
post_actions:
  - open_pr_with_docs
  - notify_tech_writer_team
```
