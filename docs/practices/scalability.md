# Scalability Best Practices

Scalability in HUG AI means more than handling traffic â€” it means scaling codebases, teams, and agent workflows responsibly.

## Dimensions of Scalability

- **Technical**: Application performance under load
- **Organizational**: Team workflows, branching strategies, agent roles
- **Process**: Reusability of prompts, modular artifacts, and templates

## Design Strategies

### 1. Modular Architecture
- Use the Architecture Agent to split systems into logical components
- Follow interface-first design for service communication

### 2. Statelessness & Idempotency
- Services should not retain state across requests
- Retry-friendly agents require idempotent outputs

### 3. Prompt and Template Reuse
- Version shared prompts and YAML templates
- Centralize prompt scaffolds in a shared registry

### 4. Reusable Agents
- Deploy agents in a way that supports horizontal scaling
- Tag and isolate long-running or stateful agents

## Development Patterns

- Use feature flags and toggles to scale releases
- Tag AI-generated code with metadata for filtering or cleanup
- Include scaling tests as part of performance validation

## Governance Implications

- As team size grows, enforce branching and PR rules via the Branch & PR Manager Agent
- Use Router Agent to coordinate work between parallel agent chains

## Tooling & Automation

- Use CI/CD pipelines to enforce consistency at scale
- Auto-generate changelogs and artifact registries
- Monitor agent execution metrics for load prediction

## Best Practices Summary

| Area             | Practice                             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Architecture     | Modular, decoupled, documented       |
| Agents           | Stateless, reusable, versioned       |
| Repos            | Feature-based branching, lint gates  |
| Prompts          | Shared, structured, tested           |
| Human Review     | Required checkpoints per PR          |
