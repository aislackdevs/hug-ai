# Best Practices Overview

This section captures the fundamental practices that support high-quality, secure, and sustainable AI-assisted development within the HUG AI methodology.

While HUG AI introduces powerful agents and flows, these practices ensure that results are:
- Aligned with engineering standards
- Compliant with governance and security expectations
- Maintainable and reproducible over time

## Focus Areas

- **Code Quality**: Maintainable, testable, readable outputs
- **Scalability**: Strategies to adapt flows for teams of any size
- **Documentation**: Keeping human and agent-generated docs consistent
- **Security**: Safeguards to prevent vulnerabilities from AI outputs

## Goals

- Build trust in AI-augmented outputs
- Reduce the burden of manual cleanup or review
- Improve collaboration between humans and agents

## Guidance Format

Each topic provides:
- Recommendations with rationale
- Tooling and automation hooks
- CI/CD considerations
- Common pitfalls and workarounds

## Who Should Read This

- Developers integrating AI agents into codebases
- Team leads designing compliant workflows
- DevOps engineers extending pipelines
- Security reviewers validating AI-generated changes
