# Tooling & Infrastructure

The **HUG AI** methodology relies on a robust ecosystem of tools and infrastructure to support AI agents, maintain code quality, enforce security, and streamline operations. This overview highlights key categories and components.

!!! info "Overview"
    A multi-layered toolchain ensures agents have the right context, outputs are validated, and deployments remain reliable. Components span core infrastructure, AI orchestration, quality/security, and operational tooling.

=== "Base Infrastructure"
    ## `Version Control & Branching`
    :   :material-source-branch: Git workflows with task-isolated branches and pull request governance.

    ## `Contextual Code Retrieval`
    :   :material-database-search: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and code search engines to feed agents curated context.

    ## `Containerization`
    :   :material-docker: Docker-based environments for consistent development, testing, and deployment.

    ## `CI/CD Pipelines`
    :   :material-pipe: Automated build, test, and release workflows enforcing quality gates.

=== "AI Orchestration Platform"
    ## `LLM-Powered Agents`
    :   :material-robot-outline: Specialized large language model agents for planning, coding, testing, and more.

    ## `Workflow Orchestrator`
    :   :material-scoreboard-outline: Coordination layer managing task handoffs and agent sequencing.

    ## `State & Context Store`
    :   :material-database-cog: Central repository for sharing context, decisions, and artifact metadata across agents.

    ## `Automated Validation`
    :   :material-check-circle-outline: Continuous checks on agent outputs for style, correctness, and compliance.

=== "Quality & Security"
    ## `Static Analysis`
    :   :material-text-search: Linters and vulnerability scanners integrated into CI for early issue detection.

    ## `Test Automation`
    :   :material-test-tube: AI-driven generation and maintenance of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

    ## `Security Scanning`
    :   :material-shield-search: Dynamic and static application security testing to catch vulnerabilities.

    ## `Performance Monitoring`
    :   :material-monitor: Observability tools tracking performance metrics and resource usage.

=== "Operations & Release Management"
    ## `Observability Stack`
    :   :material-chart-timeline-variant: Centralized logging, metrics, and alerting (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

    ## `Feature Flags`
    :   :material-flag-variant: Runtime toggles for controlled rollouts and experimentation.

    ## `Canary & Rollback Tools`
    :   :material-backup-restore: Safe deployment patterns enabling incremental releases and quick rollbacks.

=== "Custom Extensions"
    **Tailored Tooling**: Organization-specific scripts, plugins, and integrations designed to extend the core HUG AI toolchain.
