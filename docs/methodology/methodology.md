## Agent-Based Architecture

### Multi-Agent Development System

Each phase of the development lifecycle is assigned to a specialized AI agent:

| ID   | Agent Name                | SDLC Phase      | Role & Specialization                                                          |
|------|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 00   | Prompt Refiner Agent      | Planning        | Improves task prompts, confirms scope, and ensures clarity                     |
| 01   | Requirements Analyzer Agent | Planning      | Comprehensive requirements engineering and stakeholder analysis                |
| 02   | Router Agent              | Planning        | Intelligent workflow routing and agent orchestration                           |
| 03   | Architecture Agent        | Design          | System design, architecture decisions, and technical blueprints                |
| 04   | Implementation Agent      | Implementation  | Universal code implementation across any technology stack                      |
| 05   | Test Agent                | Testing         | Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e) for all technologies            |
| 06   | Documentation Writer Agent| Implementation  | Technical and user documentation generation                                    |
| 07   | Branch/PR Manager Agent   | Implementation  | Git operations, pull requests, and version control management                  |
| 08   | Internal Reviewer Agent   | Testing         | Code review, quality assessment, and improvement suggestions                   |
| 09   | Retry Agent               | Implementation  | Intelligent failure analysis, learning, and task recovery                      |
| 10   | Deployment Agent          | Deployment      | Universal deployment, CI/CD, and infrastructure automation                     |
| 11   | Maintenance Agent         | Maintenance     | Proactive maintenance, dependency updates, and health monitoring               |
| 12   | Security Agent            | Testing         | Comprehensive security analysis, vulnerability assessment, compliance          |
| 13   | Performance Agent         | Testing         | Performance optimization, monitoring, and scalability analysis                 |
| 14   | Integration Agent         | Implementation  | API management, system integration, and data pipeline orchestration            |
| 15   | DevOps Agent              | Deployment      | Infrastructure automation, CI/CD orchestration, and operational excellence     |

These agents work together like a team, passing off context, code, and decisions between phases.

### 2. **Human Governance**

* Humans never need write code ‚Äî they guide and approve.
* Pull Requests are the key governance checkpoint.
* Humans can:

  * Approve work
  * Reject and give feedback
  * Request corrections (trigger Retry Agent)

### 3. **Task Isolation**

Each task gets:

* A dedicated Git branch
* Its own AI team instance
* A clear lifecycle, tracked from idea to PR

This makes it easy to:

* Debug and trace issues
* Retry or rollback changes safely
* Run tasks in parallel without conflict

### 4. **Agent Orchestration**

A task follows a strict pipeline:

```
PROMPT_REFINE ‚Üí REQUIREMENTS ‚Üí ROUTER ‚Üí ARCHITECT ‚Üí CODER ‚Üí TESTER ‚Üí DOC ‚Üí REVIEW ‚Üí PR ‚Üí MAINTENANCE
```

Each agent works on its own phase, updates the task status, and passes it forward. This creates an autonomous but traceable workflow.

## Scalable Team-Based Architecture

### AI Teams Per Task

* Each new task (feature, bug, improvement) launches a fresh **HUG AI Development** team.
* The team operates in isolation using a unique Git branch and workspace.
* Once completed, the task results in a PR ready for human review.

### Benefits:

* Parallelism: multiple tasks handled concurrently
* Traceability: errors are scoped to a specific task/branch
* Reusability: agents can be reused or scaled independently

---

## Tools and Infrastructure

* **Git + Branch Modeling** for task tracking and delivery
* **RAG + Code Search** for code understanding
* **LLM-based Agents** with role-specific prompts
* **Universal development toolchain** (build, test, analyze)
* **PR Interface** (e.g., GitHub/GitLab) as human governance checkpoint

---

## Outcomes

* Continuous development without constant human intervention
* Human focus shifts to architecture, strategy, and validation
* Increased speed, consistency, and quality
* Governance-friendly: always explainable, reversible, and reviewable

---

## Ideal Use Cases

* Large projects with modular architectures across any technology stack
* Projects requiring strict quality gates
* Teams seeking to scale output without scaling developers
* DevOps/AIOps systems needing code-level automation with traceability

---

## Feedback and Improvement Loop

Every task result and human review is a learning opportunity:

* Retry Agent reprocesses failed tasks with improved prompts/context
* Patterns from accepted code feed future generations of agents
* Analytics on test/lint/PR results improve agent logic over time
