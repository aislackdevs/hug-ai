# Methodology Overview

The HUG AI methodology is designed to bring structure, safety, and speed to AI-assisted software development. It outlines how human developers and intelligent agents can collaborate to produce high-quality, scalable, and auditable software — without compromising engineering values.

## What is HUG AI?

**HUG AI** stands for **Human-Governed AI Software Development**.  
It’s a modular, lifecycle-based framework that combines traditional software engineering principles with generative AI capabilities — while keeping decision-making and responsibility in human hands.

## Key Principles

The methodology is founded on four core principles:

1. **Human governance is mandatory**  
   Developers and stakeholders must retain full responsibility over outputs, quality, and direction.

2. **AI is a collaborator, not a decision-maker**  
   Tools assist, suggest, and automate — but never replace human thinking.

3. **Transparency and traceability are built-in**  
   All steps, decisions, and code must be versioned and reviewable.

4. **Modularity enables control and scale**  
   AI agents are specialized and composable; each has a well-defined scope and role.

## How is it structured?

The methodology consists of:

- A full **software development lifecycle** adapted for AI collaboration.
- A **library of AI agents**, each focused on a specific SDLC responsibility.
- A set of **YAML-based templates** and tools for workflow automation.
- Best practices for team setup, process governance, and code validation.

## Why adopt it?

Adopting HUG AI helps teams:

- Deliver faster without compromising accountability or quality.
- Incorporate AI into real production workflows safely.
- Empower developers instead of replacing them.
- Build repeatable, explainable, and governed AI-assisted systems.
