# The HUG AI Lifecycle

The HUG AI methodology defines a structured **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** tailored for AI-assisted collaboration.  
Each phase of the lifecycle includes clear human oversight, AI agent support, and traceable workflows.

## Phases of the Lifecycle

The lifecycle includes the following stages:

### 1. Planning

Define project goals, user needs, risks, and requirements with human facilitation and support from AI agents.  
Artifacts: requirement documents, context summaries, project scope definitions.

### 2. Design

Architectural and technical design decisions are made by humans, with AI agents providing exploratory design options and documentation.  
Artifacts: architecture diagrams, component plans, interface specs.

### 3. Implementation

Code is generated collaboratively by developers and AI agents. Human review is mandatory.  
Code is modular, tested early, and traceable to requirements.

### 4. Testing

AI agents assist with test case generation and coverage analysis. Developers write critical tests and perform validation.  
Both human-written and AI-generated tests are versioned.

### 5. Deployment

Agents automate deployment scripts and environment configuration, supervised by DevOps and security teams.  
Focus on reproducibility, rollback readiness, and monitoring hooks.

### 6. Maintenance

AI agents assist in monitoring, error reporting, and patch proposal.  
Human operators review and validate all changes before they are merged.

## Governance at Every Step

> AI does not replace engineering judgment â€” it **amplifies** it under human governance.

Each phase includes:
- Human approvals
- Version control of prompts and outputs
- CI/CD integration with review checkpoints

## YAML-Driven Workflows

HUG AI supports **YAML-based configuration templates** to define:
- Agent responsibilities
- Prompt routing logic
- Documentation standards
- Deployment workflows

These configurations allow for repeatable, controlled, and auditable agent behavior.

## Continuous Improvement

The lifecycle is **iterative**. Feedback loops between testing, deployment, and planning ensure that both humans and AI agents learn and evolve with the product.
