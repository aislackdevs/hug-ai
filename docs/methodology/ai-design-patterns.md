# AI Design Patterns

> AI design patterns help structure AI integration in software, balancing innovation with maintainability, clarity, and trust.

## When to Use AI vs When to Avoid AI

=== "When to Use AI"
    - Automating repetitive or data-intensive tasks (e.g., log analysis, data transformation).
    - Unlocking insights from large datasets (pattern recognition, predictive analysis).
    - Enhancing user experiences with recommendations, personalization, and intelligent assistance.
    - Accelerating development workflows with code generation and smart tooling.

=== "When to Avoid AI"
    - Safety-critical operations requiring deterministic, auditable steps.
    - Tasks demanding deep human judgment, ethics, or emotional intelligence.
    - Scenarios with limited or poor-quality data where AI may misinterpret context.
    - Highly regulated environments where non-deterministic outputs pose compliance risks.

## Modular Design & Separation of Responsibilities
Maintaining clear boundaries between AI modules and core system logic improves testability, scalability, and governance.

### Single-Responsibility Agents
!!! note "Focus on a Single Concern"
    Each AI component should implement one well-defined function, such as inference, data preprocessing, post-processing, or logging.

### Orchestration Layer Pattern
!!! tip "AI Orchestrator"
    Use a dedicated orchestration layer to coordinate AI service calls, handle retries, and manage workflow transitions between AI and traditional components.

## Explainability & Transparency
Building trust in AI systems requires clear, auditable explanations of AI decisions and actions.

!!! info "Decision Logging"
    Log all AI inputs, outputs, and relevant metadata (model version, timestamp, parameters) for audits, debugging, and compliance reviews.

??? details "Example: AI Adapter Pattern"
    ```python
    from datetime import datetime
    from your_logging_lib import get_logger

    class AIAdapter:
        def __init__(self, model):
            self.model = model
            self.logger = get_logger()

        def infer(self, payload):
            result = self.model.predict(payload)
            self.logger.info({
                "input": payload,
                "output": result,
                "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
            })
            return result
    ```

Use this **AI Adapter Pattern** to wrap model interactions with preprocessing, inference, and logging concerns cleanly separated.
