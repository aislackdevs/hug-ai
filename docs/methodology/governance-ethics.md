# Governance & Ethics

> Ethical AI demands rigorous governance frameworks, proactive bias mitigation, and end-to-end traceability.

## Bias in AI Models

!!! warning "Model Bias Risks"
    AI models can perpetuate or amplify existing biases in data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.

=== "Types of Bias"
    - **Data Bias**: Imbalanced or non-representative datasets skew model outputs.
    - **Algorithmic Bias**: Model architectures or objectives introduce systematic errors.
    - **Evaluation Bias**: Testing on narrow or homogeneous benchmarks masks real-world performance gaps.

=== "Mitigation Strategies"
    - **Diverse Data Sourcing**: Curate datasets that reflect target populations and use cases.
    - **Fairness Metrics**: Measure parity across demographic groups and algorithmic fairness criteria.
    - **Human-in-the-Loop Audits**: Involve domain experts to review edge cases and flagged outcomes.
    - **Regular Re-evaluation**: Periodically retrain and validate models against updated benchmarks.

## Governance of AI Use

!!! note "Governance Framework"
    - **Policy Definition**: Establish clear guidelines on approved AI use-cases and prohibited actions.
    - **Roles & Responsibilities**: Assign governance roles (e.g., ethics board, compliance officer, AI steward).
    - **Decision Checkpoints**: Gate AI outputs through human reviews at critical stages.
    - **Regulatory Compliance**: Map processes to relevant standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, ISO/IEC 42001).

## Traceability & Validation

!!! info "Audit Trails & Logging"
    - Record all AI interactions, including inputs, outputs, model versions, and parameters.
    - Maintain immutable logs or use version-controlled model registries for accountability.

??? details "Example: AI Audit Log Entry"
    ```json
    {
        "timestamp": "2025-06-15T12:34:56Z",
        "user": "jane.doe",
        "model": "customer-churn-v2",
        "input": {"customer_id": 12345, "usage_history": [...]},
        "output": {"churn_risk": 0.82},
        "model_version": "v2.1.0",
        "decision_reviewed": true
    }
    ```

!!! tip "Validation & Approval"
    Integrate automated validation checks (e.g., invariants, fairness thresholds) and require final sign-off for production deployments.
