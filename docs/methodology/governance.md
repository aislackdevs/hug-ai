# Governance & Compliance Framework

The **Governance & Compliance Framework** in HUG AI ensures that AI-assisted development meets organizational, legal, and ethical standards. It establishes controls, roles, and auditability mechanisms across the SDLC.

## Why Governance Matters

- Prevent AI misuse or misalignment
- Ensure outputs meet ethical and legal expectations
- Maintain trust in collaborative, human-AI workflows

## Core Pillars

### 1. Role-Based Access and Responsibility
- Each agent mimics a human role (e.g., reviewer, architect)
- Output must always link back to a human responsible for validation
- Role metadata is recorded in output logs and commits

### 2. Traceability and Logging
- All agent actions are logged with context, inputs, and timestamps
- Output files include metadata headers with versioning
- Prompt lineage is tracked and stored

### 3. Validation Checkpoints
- Agent chains include mandatory human review steps
- Outputs must pass static checks (security, formatting, compliance)
- CI/CD gates enforce policy adherence

### 4. Reproducibility and Version Control
- Prompt templates and inputs are versioned in source control
- Generated outputs are committed and traceable across branches
- Git metadata includes agent source and decision history

### 5. Policy Embedding and Enforcement
- Regulatory and organizational policies are encoded into agent prompts
- Outputs are flagged if policy constraints are triggered
- Governance tags (e.g. `requires_review`, `pii_sensitive`) help automate oversight

## Tools & Agents for Governance

- **Internal Reviewer Agent**: audits quality and alignment
- **Security Agent**: evaluates compliance and exposure risks
- **Router Agent**: enforces flow control and fallback logic
- **Retry Agent**: ensures resilience and auditability in failure handling

## Enterprise Readiness
This framework is designed to support:

- Regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, finance)
- Multi-team projects with traceable responsibilities
- DevSecOps alignment and governance-as-code practices

## Recommended Practices

- Conduct governance reviews every sprint
- Train team members on agent roles and accountability
- Treat agent chains as code: tested, versioned, and observable
