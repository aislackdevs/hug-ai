# AI Risks and Mitigation Strategies

The integration of generative AI into software development introduces unique risks. HUG AI provides structured practices to mitigate them through governance, tooling, and human oversight.

## Key Risk Categories

### 1. Hallucination & Inaccuracy
- **Risk**: AI generates incorrect logic, insecure code, or fictional APIs.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Always validate outputs via test coverage and human review
  - Use verified prompt patterns and context inputs
  - Leverage Internal Reviewer and Test Agents for structural checks

### 2. Over-Reliance on AI
- **Risk**: Developers treat AI outputs as final truth without understanding or validating them.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Enforce "review before merge" as a policy
  - Promote pair programming with AI + human roles
  - Include agent confidence scoring and explainability metadata

### 3. Insecure Code Generation
- **Risk**: AI produces vulnerable patterns (e.g., injection, weak encryption)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use the Security Agent in post-processing
  - Run static and dynamic analysis via CI pipelines
  - Maintain secure coding checklists and train agents on them

### 4. Compliance and Privacy Breaches
- **Risk**: Generated code mishandles PII, violates GDPR, or leaks sensitive data
- **Mitigation**:
  - Integrate compliance validation as part of agent chains
  - Maintain up-to-date policy context and prompt constraints
  - Tag and review outputs that touch regulated data domains

### 5. Prompt Drift and Versioning Failures
- **Risk**: Small prompt changes lead to divergent, unpredictable results over time
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use versioned prompt templates
  - Track and store agent input/output pairs
  - Include checksum validation of prompt history

### 6. Misaligned Outputs or Rogue Behavior
- **Risk**: Agents act outside their intended scope or provide misleading answers
- **Mitigation**:
  - Employ Router Agent and Retry Agent with fallback logic
  - Limit agent scope through controlled prompt scaffolds
  - Monitor audit logs and review behavior regularly

## Human Oversight is Non-Negotiable
Even the most sophisticated agents must be accountable to human developers. Every recommendation, line of code, or design decision must be:

- Traceable
- Reviewable
- Overridable

## Toward Safer Generative Development
Risks are not a reason to avoid AI â€” they are a reason to govern it wisely. HUG AI treats these risks as an architectural concern, not just a QA or security phase afterthought.
