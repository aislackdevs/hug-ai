# Best Practices & Pitfalls

> Leverage proven strategies and avoid common mistakes when integrating AI into software development.

=== "Proven Best Practices"
    - Combine AI-generated suggestions with human review to maintain quality and context.
    - Define and reuse standardized prompts and templates for consistency.
    - Apply the Single-Responsibility principle to AI components for clear boundaries.
    - Integrate continuous feedback loops to refine AI outputs over time.
    - Version-control AI artifacts (prompts, models, outputs) alongside code.
    - Automate testing and validation of AI outputs within CI pipelines.

=== "Common Pitfalls & Avoidance"
    - Blindly trusting AI outputs without verification can introduce defects.
    - Over-reliance on AI for critical decision logic reduces human oversight.
    - Neglecting data quality leads to biased or inaccurate results.
    - Missing documentation of AI decision points hampers traceability.
    - Running unvetted AI-generated code in production can pose security risks.
    - Avoid monolithic AI modules; prefer modular, testable services.

=== "Evaluating AI-Generated Code Quality"
!!! info "Quality Assessment Metrics"
    - **Correctness**: Validate functionality with automated unit and integration tests.
    - **Maintainability**: Measure cyclomatic complexity and code readability (linters, code review).
    - **Security**: Scan for vulnerabilities using SAST tools and dependency checks.
    - **Performance**: Benchmark critical paths and analyze resource usage.
    - **Documentation**: Ensure docstrings and external docs are accurate and up to date.

??? details "Example: Automated Quality Check Script"
    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # Run tests, linting, and security scan on AI-generated code
    pytest tests/ai_generated
    flake8 src/ai_module
    bandit -r src/ai_module
    ```

Use this script as part of your CI/CD pipeline to enforce consistent quality gates on AI-generated code.
