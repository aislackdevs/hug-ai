# Case Studies — Pilot Overview

The first pilot projects using **HUG AI** emerged from internal SlackDevs experiments and consulting engagements with multiple companies across different industries.

## Experimentation Goals

- Validate that AI agents can accelerate development without compromising quality
- Design workflows that ensure human oversight at every critical point
- Create a modular, reusable framework that adapts to different team structures

## Where We Started

Initial pilots included:
- Startups seeking to automate MVP delivery
- Enterprise teams exploring AI pair programming
- Remote-first squads needing async agent flows

## Early Findings

- **Developer Productivity**: Teams reduced implementation time by 30–50% using paired agents
- **Quality Assurance**: Review loops were necessary to catch edge-case errors from agents
- **Documentation**: Agent-generated documentation helped onboard new team members faster

## Challenges Faced

- Prompt drift across long projects
- Version control for evolving prompts and templates
- Building trust between developers and AI outputs

## Lessons Integrated into the Methodology

- Codified agent roles (e.g., implementation_agent, reviewer_agent)
- Introduced fallback, retry, and escalation logic
- Centralized prompts and governance policies

## What's Next

The learnings from these pilots are now baked into the structure of HUG AI. Future case studies will explore:
- Cross-org usage in regulated industries
- Security agent performance at scale
- CI/CD automation via agent chains
