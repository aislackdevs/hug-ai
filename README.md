# HUG AI Development Documentation

> "We don't automate developers â€” we multiply them."

A comprehensive methodology for **Human-Governed AI Software Development** that combines human expertise with AI capabilities to enhance productivity, quality, and innovation throughout the software development lifecycle.

## What is HUG AI?

**HUG AI** (Human-Governed AI) is a structured approach to software development that leverages AI technologies to augment human capabilities while maintaining human oversight, accountability, and decision-making authority.

### Core Principles

- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Combining human creativity and domain expertise with AI capabilities
- **Quality-Driven Development**: Prioritizing code quality, security, and maintainability
- **Agile and Adaptive**: Flexible processes that adapt to different project sizes and contexts
- **Context-Aware**: Ensuring AI tools have access to necessary context for optimal assistance
- **Continuous Learning**: Systems that improve over time through human feedback

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aislackdevs/hug-ai.git
   cd hug-ai
   ```

2. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   ./sdc-serve.sh
   ```
   This will set up the Python environment, install dependencies, and start the MkDocs server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

3. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   ./sdc-build.sh
   ```

### Manual Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Serve locally
mkdocs serve

# Build site
mkdocs build
```
